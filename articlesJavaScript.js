  ["Hamilton holds off Verstappen for tactically brilliant win at Bahrain GP","['Seven-times champion and Mercedes pull off strategic coup', 'Verstappen and Red Bull settle for second after securing pole']","['With his victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton delivered an emphatic and salutary reminder that if Max Verstappen is to wrest the title from the champion’s grasp he will be fought every inch of the way.', 'Formula One moreover could not have asked for a more spectacular, gripping finale to the season-opening race than the deciding laps at the Sakhir circuit. Hamilton’s win for Mercedes over Red Bull’s Verstappen was as unexpected as it was enthralling and it was the fight the sport had been waiting for.', 'The new season had promised a potential contest between the 23-year-old Verstappen, for the first time in his career in machinery that can challenge for the title, and the 36-year-old Hamilton, attempting to take his eighth championship.', 'It was a mouthwatering prospect and the pair duly delivered in a climax that was impossible to predict until the chequered flag flew. When ultimately Hamilton and Mercedes had taken one of their most unlikely wins given the form book going into the race, the scale of the achievement was clear as the team celebrated almost as if they had won the title.', 'The pair vied for the lead right across the final six laps, Hamilton in front and Verstappen charging. For brief seconds the Dutchman took the lead only for the highest drama to play out at high speed.', 'The Red Bull driver had the place but had to allow Hamilton to take it back as he had gone off the track to make the move, against the rules which are hard and fast in this scenario. Verstappen was left to rue not quite calling it to perfection after a race he had, until that point, executed with inch-perfect precision.', '“The pressure was immense.” Hamilton said. “He is a fantastic driver and they have the quicker car. That was one of the hardest races I have had for a while. We had such a great fight here and they are going to come back with a vengeance in the next race.”', 'The victory was clearly of immense satisfaction to the world champion, coming as it did with Mercedes under the cosh against Red Bull who had been faster all weekend, quickest across practice and with a clear pace advantage in qualifying. Yet when it mattered – as they have done so many times in the past – Mercedes and Hamilton were able to find another level. The team has been superlative operationally in winning the past seven drivers’ and constructors’ championships and they once again delivered at the Sakhir circuit. They could not match the Red Bull for pace but pulled off a coup.', 'Mercedes had done all they could with an alternate tyre strategy to give Hamilton a shot at Verstappen while Red Bull held their nerve and stuck to their own plan.', 'The two drivers were in a race of their own out front and a cat-and-mouse series of pit stops ensued but after both had stopped twice Verstappen emerged eight seconds behind Hamilton, the world champion leading with 16 laps remaining but with tyres that he had already run for 10 laps.', 'Red Bull had brought Verstappen in on lap 40 for his final stop and it was a straight fight for the win. He set about the task and duly flew, catching the champion on lap 50. Two laps later he was on his gearbox as Hamilton’s worn tyres told, and the hard but fair racing was unmissable. The British driver defended stoutly but Verstappen passed him on lap 53 at the outside of turn four only to edge just wide putting all four wheels off the track. A tiny margin but enough to ultimately cost him the race. A reminder also that with passing in these cars so hard, the track position Mercedes had opted for proved the better option.', 'Verstappen had three laps to try again but his tyres had passed their best, he could not get close enough and Hamilton showed all his experience to hold the lead and take the victory by only seven-tenths of a second.', 'It is now 30 years since his father first raced and Mick Schumacher of the Haas team, the 22 year-old son of seven-time world champion Michael, had a spin early in the race on his F1 debut but recovered to finish in 16th. The double world champion Fernando Alonso, in his return to F1 after a two-year absence, had to retire with brake problems on lap 34.', 'Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas was in third and Lando Norris was an excellent fourth for McLaren. Sergio Pérez did well to recover his Red Bull to finish fifth having started at the back after a mechanical problem on the formation lap.', 'The seven-times world champion Hamilton knows he is up against it this season and securing every point may prove vital in a title fight that could go to the wire. There are 22 more races between now and December and if this is what the season holds in store Formula One has the makings of classic championship fight on its hands.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-28",18.2,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae01c6d13b423c4e4c6228a1fe6b47cd3dc4120/342_0_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=3b1bd33239995cd93fe79f6c8a11215a","Lewis Hamilton embraces his Mercedes team after sealing a stunning win at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

With Max Verstappen topping both sessions, the reigning world champion, Lewis Hamilton, and his Mercedes team had to admit that as things stand they are simply unable to match their rivals.', 'Hamilton, attempting to take his eighth world championship this season, accepted that he and Mercedes, having dominated F1 since 2014, were now on the back foot. “It wasn’t where we wanted,” he said. “This weekend it is looking better but not perfect. We still have a hill to climb but we are staying positive.”', 'The British driver again highlighted the unstable nature of the car that has been evident in the Mercedes since testing. “We thought Red Bull would be as fast as they are,” he said. “We know they are leading at the moment, we will work away tonight and try and find a way.”', 'In the morning running, contested under atypical daytime conditions, Red Bull already appeared to have carried their form from testing into the first weekend of this 23-race season. Verstappen was quickest, almost three-tenths up on the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, while Hamilton was almost half a second back from the Red Bull in fourth, while McLaren’s Lando Norris an impressive third.', 'In the evening session, taking place in the conditions under floodlights representative of the race, Red Bull – who had headed the times in pre-season testing – proved their package is genuinely as strong as it had been hoped. Verstappen put in a time of 1min 30.847sec, over half a second up on his previous best and enough to leave Hamilton in third, two-tenths back. Norris and McLaren, who finished third in the constructors’ championship last season, will take heart from their strong showing, the British driver claiming second only a 10th of a second down on Verstappen.', 'Having already pronounced testing the best of his career, Verstappen retained his cautious optimism. “It’s been a good day,” he said. “With the heat, not easy to find a really good balance around the whole lap but it was a positive day. Now we have to show what we can do in qualifying.”', 'Mercedes’ team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted that the best scenario for his team at this point was just to be able to match Red Bull’s pace. “From what I’ve seen and what I hope is that we can have a really tough fight; it’s what the fans want to see and what we would like to have,” he said. “I think if we are behind, then we just need to catch up and do a good job. If we’re just about on the same pace – which I would consider today maybe as the best possible scenario for us – then we’re up for the fight with another great team.”', 'In their favour on long runs, simulating race pace, Mercedes did appear to be on a par with Red Bull.', 'Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times champion Michael, put in a solid performance in his debut as an F1 driver. In an uncompetitive Haas, the German was 18th in the evening, two spots in front of teammate Nikita Mazepin and Williams’ Nicholas Latifi in 19th.', 'Fernando Alonso, returning after a two-season absence, was in 15th for Alpine, four places down on his teammate Esteban Ocon.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-26",18.03,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dca70bb704bd45c04b08ded59b0d5a746435ee2a/0_130_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=b54ed644db23194d02d851279c34d0b1","Max Verstappen during evening practice.

  ["Brundle and Hill expect Verstappen to challenge Hamilton for F1 title","['Former drivers impressed by Red Bull in winter testing', 'Brundle: ‘Max looks as lean and as mean as I have seen him’']","['Martin Brundle believes Lewis Hamilton is going to face a strong challenge from Red Bull for the Formula One world championship this season. His views were echoed by the former world champion Damon Hill, who insists Hamilton will relish a fight with his chief rival Max Verstappen.', 'The season begins this Sunday at the Bahrain Grand Prix and Hamilton is attempting to take a record eighth title having won six in the past seven years. His Mercedes team have dominated the sport since 2014 and were all but untouchable last season, although they have looked vulnerable in winter testing this year.', 'In contrast, Red Bull appear to have gone from strength to strength over the winter and were quickest in testing after displaying formidable reliability with the experienced Mexican Sergio Pérez alongside Verstappen in an outstanding driver lineup.', '“They have obviously found something with their car, they had a great test,” said Brundle, who took part in 165 races during his F1 career. “Max looks as lean and as mean as I have seen him, Sergio looks relaxed and comfortable, they had a wonderful test. Unless Mercedes were carrying heavy fuel with the engine on a very low mode and they were having a laugh with us all, it does appear to be game on with Red Bull.”', 'Mercedes lost track time in testing with mechanical issues and were off the pace, concerned at a lack of rear grip, while Hamilton made some highly uncharacteristic errors.', '“They had one of those tests where if it could go wrong it did go wrong,” Brundle said. “The sight of Lewis standing beside a stricken car in a gravel trap, you have to do a double take, when did we last see that happen? Or Lewis spinning on cold tyres coming into the pit straight? They just had one of these tests and I do think they have work to do, it did not go well.”', 'Hill, who won his title with Williams in 1996, agreed but believes Hamilton will only enjoy the motivation of a tough fight.', '“Lewis might be a little bit concerned about how Mercedes’ test went,” he said. “They have shown a little bit of vulnerability they didn’t want to show but he is a big boy and he will be as committed as ever. It might be more difficult but that won’t be off-putting for Lewis, he won’t mind having a fight. If it is a fight with Max he will relish that.', '“More than any season I can think of for quite a while it looks like there is a change of form. My hopes are up for a much tighter championship.”', 'Hamilton said he could not find the car’s sweet spot and the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has conceded his team are struggling to get to grips with the characteristics of the W12. “The car was a bit toxic to drive and fairly unstable, especially with the crosswind,” Wolff said.', '“It seems like we have a little diva, like the car from two years ago, that we haven’t really understood yet. The fact we only had a few days of testing certainly didn’t help. We haven’t yet understood the car the way we want to.”', 'Red Bull have not been in contention for a title since they last won the championship in 2013. Verstappen has returned race wins but the team have often been trying to catch up to Mercedes across a season. This year they look to be strong out of the blocks but Verstappen remains cautious until the real form is displayed in qualifying in Bahrain. “I see every season as a new opportunity to beat them, but we would be stupid to expect that fight to be easy and look at testing and think we are ahead,” he said.', 'Brundle is convinced Red Bull will have lost none of the competitive edge if they are in a close fight this season. “They can match Mercedes operationally because they are a mighty team,” he said. “If they have reliability, particularly from the power unit, I have no doubt that Red Bull know how to deliver a championship campaign.”', 'Hamilton has said he was happier Mercedes encountered issues in testing rather than when the season begins and remains confident his team will step up. Mercedes have been operating at a remarkably high level for the past seven years and Brundle concluded that Red Bull and Verstappen would have to be at the very top of their game to prevent Hamilton successfully defending his title.', '“If Lewis is happy and focused and with the might of Mercedes that is still the combo to beat,” he said. “Max would have to make sure he makes no mistakes because Lewis very rarely makes a mistake. Red Bull will have to hook everything up to beat them.”', 'Damon Hill and Martin Brundle are part of the Sky Sports F1 team.

Hamilton is attempting to take a record eighth title this year but has in the past fended off accusations that his success has been attributable to being in the best car. Here was unequivocal evidence against that suggestion, he said.', '“There are always opportunities to prove people wrong and today is definitely one of them,” he said. “There have been many in the past and I hope there are many in the future to be able to show what I was able to do today. We don’t have the fastest car at the moment, that’s all good for me. I don’t mind having to pull out extra in order to make the difference.”', 'Verstappen definitively had the quickest car over the weekend but Mercedes had the more successful strategy while Hamilton was able to nurse his worn tyres at the end, holding off the Red Bull after high drama when Verstappen took the lead only to have to hand it back having gone off track to do so.', 'It was enthralling racing and suggests a real battle between the pair is on the cards this season. The British driver was revelling in the prospect.', '“I loved every minute of it,” he said. “I am super happy for the fans that they are excited, this is something they have wanted for a long time. It’s only one race, we don’t know what the future holds. With the pace they have they could be ahead a lot more but we are going to work as hard as we can to stay close in this battle and I hope for a lot more races with Max.

Formula One formally announced the decision on Wednesday and confirmed it will be replaced on the calendar over the weekend of 12-13 June by the Turkish Grand Prix in Istanbul.', 'In an official statement said F1 said: “We are grateful for the efforts of the promoter and the authorities in Canada in the past few weeks to try and make the race happen and we are pleased to announce a two-year extension to our partnership with the Canadian Grand Prix.', '“We will work with the promoter to ensure those with tickets from [the] 2020 and 2021 races get the options of a refund or to transfer their tickets to next year’s race and look forward to racing in Canada in 2022.”', 'The race in Montreal has been expected to be called off for some time.

  ["F1 to bring in new testing to curb use of ‘bendy’ rear wings","['Static tests and on-board cameras will be in use from 15 June', 'Lewis Hamilton has questioned advantage gained by Red Bull']","['Formula One is to introduce new tests to ensure teams are not breaking the rules by using flexible rear wings. The issue was raised by Lewis Hamilton during the Spanish Grand Prix, where he questioned the advantage Red Bull may have gained from using what he called a “bendy” rear wing.', 'What are described as “moveable aerodynamic parts” have long been banned. However, teams always attempt to push the boundaries of these rules and wings that could flex under load may reduce drag on straights, increasing straight-line speed. After qualifying in Spain where he took pole, Hamilton suggested Red Bull were managing to get round the rigorous tests on movement of wings when the cars are stationary.', '“The Red Bulls are really fast on the straights,” he said. “They have this bendy wing on the back of their car which they put on today and they gained at least three tenths.”', 'The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, denied any infringement, stating their wing had passed all the rigidity tests required by the FIA. However, it is understood the FIA has now written to the teams warning it had observed some cars had passed static tests but may have demonstrated wing movement while in motion.', 'The governing body has told the teams it will introduce new static tests from 15 June. It will also then use on-board cameras to monitor the wings while in motion, with markings required to enable observation of movement.', 'Nikolas Tombazis, the FIA head of single seaters, wrote to the teams and insisted the introduction of new tests mid-season was necessary because of fears that wing movement could be being used to improve aerodynamic performance. “We will be looking out for any anomalous behaviour of the deformation of the rear wing,” he said.', 'The teams have been given a month before the new tests and monitoring system come in to allow them to enact any changes necessary. They will be able to use their current designs for the next three meetings: next week in Monaco, followed by Azerbaijan and potentially Turkey.', 'The race in Istanbul scheduled for 13 June remains in doubt, however. It was only recently added to the calendar to replace the cancelled Canadian GP, but with Turkey on the red list for travel from the UK it seems increasingly unlikely to go ahead. F1 is expected to make an announcement on Friday regarding the fate of the Turkish GP. There is potential that the French GP will be moved forward by two weeks to replace Turkey and then a second race in Austria added to take France’s original slot.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-05-12",17.11,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e08902c87e6a85fab2ee1d55235c8568776e654a/0_102_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7b194f0a7ca30f3ccf1dd3b423b7e484","Max Verstappen’s Red Bull.

With Naomi Osaka drawing attention to mental-health issues around professional sport, Norris voiced his concern before this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a meeting that forms part of the longest season in F1 history.', 'The McLaren driver is enjoying a hugely competitive season and is currently third in the drivers’ championship. He and McLaren may be riding high but Norris was moved to highlight his disquiet over the demands of a 23-race season by Osaka’s withdrawal from the French Open.', 'Last year the 21-year-old revealed that he had hidden his struggles with anxiety and nerves during his debut F1 season in 2019 and that he sought help to deal with it. “We don’t talk about mental health as much as we should – and we really should,” said Norris, echoing Lewis Hamilton’s remarks on Thursday praising Osaka for bringing the issue to the fore.', '“I am sorry she is going through such things,” he said. “I have the utmost respect for her in coming out and saying these things and taking the action she has, putting herself first which is most important. I feel like I did struggle a lot but I am better now, I am in a much better place than I was.”', 'On Friday the Singapore GP was cancelled because of coronavirus restrictions but F1 is confident it has options to replace it. The sport still hopes, Covid-permitting, to hold 23 races, presenting a punishing schedule. There are currently four triple-headers, including three sets with only one week off between each, amounting to nine meetings in 11 weeks.', 'Norris had concerns for engineers and mechanics who work long hours across a race week, believing that F1 may be asking too much of its personnel.', '“F1 are doing more and more and they are going down the right path but 23 races is not a help toward that,” he said. “23 races is tough. The amount of racing is the only thing which can start to impact and take a toll on the team because they don’t get to see their families much especially with Covid and isolation. For me that is one of the biggest things.”', 'Race-hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income in F1 and after the season was curtailed last year with the consequent loss of revenue, the sport wanted to maximise the returns from this season. F1’s first triple-header took place in 2018 and was not received well by the teams, the consensus being that it would not be repeated. Last year triple headers were accepted as the only way to complete the 17-race season but the challenge of 2021 is far harder.', 'The teams are considering having to rotate personnel to ensure they have sufficient time off but that comes with an attendant increase in costs. Team bosses have expressed concern over the strain on their crews, as has Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.', '“In the end, the mechanics are the ones who are going to suffer a bit,” he said. “While the big bosses in Formula One arrive later and leave earlier, so of course there it doesn’t really change much.”', 'McLaren have a partnership with the mental health charity Mind and Norris believes they have made great strides in creating support structures. “As a team there is a lot in place now,” he said. “Not just for us as drivers but for the mechanics, the engineers because they are away from their families a lot. We do a lot with them in order for anyone in the team to come forward and speak to whoever they need to, not thinking they have to stay quiet.”', 'On the track in Baku, Mercedes struggled during practice. Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by four points in the world championship, headed the timesheets in first practice and his teammate Sergio Pérez was on top in the afternoon.', 'Hamilton however was left floundering off the pace.

  ["F1 to review rules after criticism of Belgian GP ‘race’ behind safety car","['McLaren’s Zak Brown: ‘We need a better solution as a sport’', 'F1 rejects Hamilton’s claim that decision was based on money']","['Formula One is to instigate urgent discussions to prevent a repeat of the scenario under which the Belgian Grand Prix was declared a race after only three laps behind the safety car in heavy rain.', 'There were scathing attacks after the events of Sunday, including from Lewis Hamilton, who described it as a farce, driven by financial considerations, and demanded that the fans should be refunded. ', 'F1 has since insisted financial expediency was not behind the decision. Nonetheless, other senior figures in the sport have declared Formula One must consider alternative options when races are threatened by bad weather.', 'The race at Spa-Francorchamps had initially been delayed by more than three hours as heavy rain made standing water and visibility too treacherous for racing. Then, despite the conditions having not improved, the governing body, the FIA, declared the race could begin. The cars duly emerged from the pit lane and completed three laps behind the safety car.', 'They completed the mandatory two laps for the event to be counted as a race and for half points to be awarded. The top finishing order remained exactly as it had been decided in qualifying. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was in first place, from George Russell for Williams, and the Mercedes of Hamilton in third.', 'The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, was forthright in his opinion that F1 had to act to prevent a repeat of events that had tarnished the sport’s image. “The regulations state after you do a few laps it can be called a race and that needs to be reviewed,” he said. “I don’t think there is anyone that would argue the weather was safe to race in but we need a better solution as a sport. When that type of situation happens the outcome should not be a race after three laps behind a safety car.', '“That needs to be reviewed by all of us to learn from Sunday and realise if we are given this type of situation what we would do differently to make sure everyone gets their race in, whether that is the following day, or it comes back. It is complicated with the schedule but I don’t think anyone would say it felt right, calling that a race.”', 'The FIA race director, Michael Masi, said the governing body had followed its safety regulations and that the laps completed behind the safety car were to see what the conditions were like, with hope that there would be a window in the weather.', 'Masi believes F1, the FIA and the teams will meet shortly to address alternative options in future. “After this weekend and at our next meeting for next year we’ll look at a whole lot of things, to see what everyone wants,” he said. “We are at one of those points that the FIA works with all 10 teams and F1 to develop the regulations. So we will go through all of the various scenarios and see what everyone thinks.”', 'He also stated that despite other racing organisations such as IndyCar and Nascar having postponed and then held races on a Monday, F1 could not do so at Spa for a range of reasons. Rescheduling for the Monday would require agreement from F1, all the teams, the FIA and the race promoter. ', 'Logistically, it would have been extraordinarily complex; not least from a safety perspective in ensuring that all the marshals, who are volunteers, could return on what is a normal working day. There is also the issue of transport, flights and equipment and crew all booked into a tight schedule to get the teams to the next round, this weekend at Zandvoort in the Netherlands. It would also be expensive to rearrange.', 'F1’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, meanwhile rejected Hamilton’s allegation that, despite only the minimum laps required to classify it as a race being completed, it was done to meet obligations to broadcasters, sponsors and ticket holders that would otherwise be entitled to financial recompense.', '“When I hear that there was some commercial discussion behind that, it’s totally not true,” he said. “When we’re talking about racing, there is responsibility, that is a clear process.”', 'He insisted that F1 would have received its race fee without the required laps happening and supported the decision made by the FIA in stopping and then restarting the race albeit briefly.', 'On Sunday the race promoters had no plan nor precedent for any scenario where a race had effectively not occurred.

  ["Dominic Thiem beats Zverev to set up Djokovic clash in Australian Open final","[' Austrian beats German 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4)']","['It is rare that a player wins a slam by beating both Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in either order, in the same fortnight. Stan Wawrinka did it here in 2014 and Roger Federer came within two points of doing it at Wimbledon last year in a final against the Serbian that left him shattered.', 'So, Dominic Thiem, who defeated Nadal in the quarter-finals two days ago and reached the final with an intelligent dismantling of his dangerous but frenzied German friend, Alexander Zverev, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), in the second semi-final on Friday, will join an elite group if he can overcome Djokovic on Sunday. It is the tallest of orders.', 'As Thiem said courtside on Friday,: “I’m always facing the kings of the grand slams in finals. I lost to Rafa twice at Roland Garros. Now I’m facing Novak. He’s the king of Australia.”', 'He added: “It was an unreal match, two tie-breaks, so tough and so close. It is hard to break him [Zverev]. He had such a high percentage on his first serve [81%]. After playing four hours and 10 minutes against Rafa, I was in bed around 5am. It was not easy to recover, but the adrenaline came. Still, I had some troubles. We started with two breaks in our first semi-final here.', '“In the semi-finals of a slam, the level is so high and there are so many key moments, such as at the end of the second set. Then I was two set points down in the fourth, and saved [for the tie-break]. At the start of the fourth I was feeling nervous, putting so much effort, feeling my stomach, it was rebelling a little bit.', '“Sascha had a horrible ATP Cup and he worked so hard in preparation week for here. We’ve known he’s a great player for a very long time. Either of us could have won today. He’s still only 22. We won’t have to wait long until he’s in his first grand slam final.”', 'Thiem, at 26, is in his third against the defending champion reaching for his eighth Australian title and 17th major. History is weighing Thiem down elsewhere; he would be the first man born in the 1990s to win a major, and that would place him at the forefront of the new wave of challengers to the hegemony of the Big Three.', 'Both players were edgy in the early exchanges and it became obvious that, if neither could build an extended stretch of dominance, the match would go long. Zverev hit some huge winners to take the first set in 40 minutes, but Thiem, more defensive, recovered to level in exactly the same time.', 'The lights over one baseline failed briefly at the start of the third set – appropriate, perhaps, as both were playing lights-out tennis – and there was a seven-minute delay. The interruption seemed to disrupt Thiem, who missed a chance to go two games clear, more than it did Zverev who got back on serve and then pressured the Austrian for the rest of the frame.', 'Angered that a clean free-pointer was called out and not overruled – he had no challenges left – Zverev drilled a pair of statement aces and carried his rage into the next game, the longest to that point in the set. But Thiem stood firm, saving two break points, then forcing the tie-break after a love hold by Zverev.', 'While the German had outserved Thiem, the Austrian was playing the big moments more calmly, and went a set up with a superbly angled backhand.', 'Now small distractions invaded Zverev’s concentration. The match was heading for three hours, at 15-all in the second game of the fourth set, when, having already questioned the reliability of the let machine, he complained to the chair umpire about a screen high in the arena that clicked with fresh statistics after each point. In as much as it was in his line of vision, it had been like that throughout the tournament.', 'He held, but Thiem’s mood had switched from concerned to convinced he could win. It was the look he had when beating Nadal in the quarter-finals. But looks don’t win matches; points do.', 'Zverev was hitting with more venom, Thiem had relaxed certainty on his racket and, receiving in the ninth game, he worked his way to within two points of reaching the final. Zverev held for 5-5, and again, nervously, for the second tie-break.', 'There he double-faulted and made a mess of a routine smash at 2-4. He served at 4-6 but could do nothing about Thiem’s delicate volley at the end of three hours and 42 minutes of very good tennis.']","Australian Open 2020","Sport","2020-01-31",12.49,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5336ceb01111504fcce2c6ae35cc42641a9b26ed/144_343_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=f28bfcb5ea65a60b6ae44e1db600a369","Dominic Thiem celebrates after winning against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open.

He had that leg strapped for the semi-final and there were moments in some of the longer rallies in the two hours and 18 minutes in which he and Djokovic traded quality shots when his movement looked limited. Djokovic was pulling away at the end, to win 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3 and rarely has a scoreline been such an accurate barometer of the facts.', 'The first set was a microcosm of their rivalry. Federer blazed early – three aces in five minutes; after half an hour he held to love for 5-2 – before Djokovic worked his way into the story, and then they battled on level terms for a while before Federer’s resistance waned. Even on two good legs, he would have done well to break down Djokovic’s defence once the fire went out.', 'For nearly 40 minutes, Federer was in near-total control. He had struck 20 clean winners, eight of them aces. Then he briefly went missing and Djokovic, still fighting his own game, broke him to love. That was the turning point. He gave up only one point in the shootout and set about systematically hurting his stricken rival.', 'Federer had a medical timeout. He was not the same when he came back. As Mats Wilander observed on Eurosport: “It seemed like Novak could feel that Roger couldn’t move in to the corners, so he was trying to extend the rallies to get Federer wide on the backhand, or wide on the forehand and Roger was working against that.', '“Roger did not serve very well in the tie-breaker in the first set, that was the first time I realised something was slightly wrong. Clearly Roger was OK to put up a great fight. The first two sets were close. If I didn’t think he was injured before I would have never noticed.”', 'Djokovic explained how he fashioned his 27th win over Federer in their 50th match. “With Roger, you’re going to expect a high level of tennis,” he said. “He will always be aggressive, [apply] constant pressure, serve and volley. I’m not as natural as he is but I tried to stay with him in the rally, move him around, and not make too many unforced errors.”', 'In fact he kept them down to 18, about half Federer’s count. After the initial blitz, he soaked up 15 aces and fashioned 11 of his own. The second set was competitive but an air of inevitability entered the equation in the third. Djokovic put six aces past Federer and struck 12 of his 31 winners in the home stretch.', 'As for their mutual bond, Djokovic said: “I hope I made him a 20% better player than what he did to me. He’s one of my biggest two rivals in slams, Roger and Rafa. They made a considerable difference in my mind and how I play. It took a lot of thinking, belief and work to perfect the game and challenge those guys on the bigger stage.”', 'A more youthful challenge awaits him on Sunday – against Alexander Zverev or Dominic Thiem – and he said: “When you’re young you want everything right away. There’s no waiting. They are among the best young players, and have the potential to be there. One thing I lacked when I was younger was patience and trusting the process a little bit more. But that’s how you learn.”', 'These two fine champions have learned so much from each other, sharing the same tenacity and drive, but going about their business on court in such contrasting styles. Like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier were, they are almost a perfect fit.', 'But their statistics tell the story. Federer won seven of their first nine matches between 2006 and 2009. Things turned in Djokovic’s favour in 2011, when he burst into greatness, and after a prolonged spell of dominance from the Serb the pair continued to trade victories. However in their last 13 meetings, dating back to 2015, Djokovic has now won 10 of them. That is a trend that looks unlikely to change.']","Australian Open 2020","Sport","2020-01-30",12.48,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a529c54769e3ee8f8f1f78beb18f0cea9df9b2f/0_154_3402_2041/master/3402.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=42010085410f574c7e54ebe51d700f5e","Novak Djokovic celebrates success in the semi-final of the Australian Open.

  ["Thomas Tuchel says he is happier at Chelsea than he has been in years","['“I love it when other people are happy,” Thomas Tuchel said, imagining the after-party if Chelsea beat Manchester City in the Champions League final on Saturday night. “It means more to me around Christmas that I have good presents for others. It’s very hard to give me a gift. Maybe I’m not the guy to dance on the table, but I will be so super-happy if we win and I see my team, my staff, the families, and when I feel what it means to my family. This is huge for me.”']","['Five months after arriving in London, Tuchel sounds as if he is in a good place. The acrimonious manner of his split from Paris Saint-Germain, who sacked him on Christmas Eve, is in the past. Tuchel has barely put a foot wrong since joining Chelsea in January and, in contrast to the snappy persona he often presented at PSG and Borussia Dortmund, is in a compelling and playful mood as he prepares to face City in Porto.', 'Almost everything suggests that Chelsea picked well when they replaced Frank Lampard with Tuchel. Although they lost the FA Cup final to Leicester a fortnight ago, they qualified for the Champions League last weekend and stand 90 minutes from becoming European champions for the second time.', 'Their revival is down to Tuchel, who has united the dressing room and created a tactically cohesive unit. “I like a lot that the players here don’t go by instinct into the same groups,” Chelsea’s manager said. “They mix and I’m very happy that I don’t have to do it. I told them after two or three days here: ‘I like this a lot and don’t change it.’”', 'The concern when Tuchel joined was whether he would be able to handle the internal politics at Stamford Bridge. He admitted at the time that he was surprised when Chelsea, languishing in ninth place, offered only an 18-month deal. Yet Tuchel, who began his management career at Mainz in 2009, got on with it. The abrasiveness that overshadowed his spells at Dortmund and PSG has not been seen and Tuchel would be happy to discuss an extensionthis summer.', '“This is very easy,” he said. “I’m so happy to be here. I never felt so good since I was in Mainz [he left in 2014] and this feels like the perfect place and the perfect moment for the perfect place. Whatever will come will come. We cannot force things, but this is my point of view.”', 'Tuchel, who studied for a business administration degree and briefly worked as a barman in Stuttgart after injury forced him to retire aged 25, is a football obsessive. It can be amusing to watch him hopping up and down on the touchline when Chelsea’s moves break down but he does not mind if his players think he is off the wall.', '“It’s good if they laugh about me,” he said. “We should not take ourselves too seriously. I feel respect if they don’t laugh about me in a disrespectful way. We laugh about each other and I need to laugh about myself. There is no funnier place than a dressing room. There is no funnier place on earth. It’s impossible.', '“If they sometimes think the coach is crazy, good. If they sometimes are even a little bit in fear, good, even better. A little bit of fear is always good. And if we can laugh it out and if they are not scared to express their feelings, then it’s the way. We are all a little bit crazy.”', 'Tuchel’s tactical nous will be challenged by Pep Guardiola but he will not try to second-guess Manchester City’s manager. “It is always difficult to face Man City, Bayern or Barcelona when Pep is on the sideline,” he says. “Maybe they are the strongest team in Europe and maybe the world and they have built a huge gap between them and us in the league but we closed the gap for 90 minutes [in winning at City this month]. At Wembley [in the FA Cup], we closed the gap again for 90 minutes and that’s what we want to do again.”', 'Chelsea will have to be at their best. “Maybe we are slight underdogs but that changes nothing,” Tuchel says. “I want to encourage them to be brave, stay active, defend and attack with aggression.”', 'Tuchel lives a quiet life away from football. He meditates, reads, spends time with his family and thinks about his team. “Normally during the season, I drink no alcohol,” he said. “A glass of gin and tonic maybe but it’s almost zero.”', 'Yet Tuchel will let loose if Chelsea overcome City. He thinks about knocking back the gin and tonics. “We will have fun,” he promises.']","Chelsea","Sport","2021-05-28",17,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab2c9c743020c3175687170cf109d6661fc3c5e/0_159_5389_3235/master/5389.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=c24c18d72e22f5cab8d623384ee62b10","Thomas Tuchel says he was delighted to discover that Chelsea’s players avoid cliques.

  ["Manchester City and Chelsea continue to learn the lessons of Sacchi’s revolution","['The philosophies of Arrigo Sacchi, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola will be evident in Saturday’s Champions League final']","['Like art, business or politics, football is shaped by personalities. The present one is influenced by three coaches from Italy, Portugal and Spain. This will also be evident at Saturday’s Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City, the highlight of the season.', 'The decisive innovation can be traced back to Arrigo Sacchi. He invented the operating system that is still valid, the Microsoft of football, without which nothing works: ball-oriented spatial coverage. With this kind of choreographed play, he shaped Milan around the outstanding individualists Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Ruud Gullit and Roberto Donadoni into the strongest team in the world. They reached their zenith in 1989, beating Real Madrid 5-0 in the semi-finals of the European Cup and Steaua Bucharest, winners in 1986 and with the future world star Gheorghe Hagi in their team, 4-0 in the final.', 'Their moves were of a higher quality and the brilliantly organised Milan kept involving the opponent in duels that led to ball losses. Steaua hardly crossed the halfway line, goals inevitably fell and the winner was clear after 30 minutes. Any self-respecting coach must have seen these 90 minutes of unequal competition.', 'Sacchi drove progress, first in Italy. Other Misters, as Italy’s coaches are known for their appearance and wardrobe, adopted his style. Most notably Fabio Capello, who dominated Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona with Milan in a 4-0 victory in the 1994 final. Or Marcello Lippi, who reached three finals in a row with Juventus from 1996 to 1998, and one player under Sacchi, Carlo Ancelotti, has won the trophy three times as a coach.', 'At that time, Italy’s football was the ultimate because patrons such as Silvio Berlusconi and Angelo Moratti financed the clubs. With their millions, they attracted the best players. As a result, Serie A won the European Cup/Champions League five times between 1989 and 2003, and the Uefa Cup and the Cup Winners’ Cup a combined 11 out of 26 times. During that time, seven clubs from Italy won a European trophy, including Parma, Sampdoria, Napoli and Lazio. No league could match that.', 'Germany also benefited from Italy’s high standard. In 1990, West Germany became world champions, partly because almost half the team around Lothar Matthäus played in Serie A. From 1995, the modern operating system was installed in Bayern Munich’s junior team; the ball-oriented spatial coverage and the four-man back line were revolutionary in Germany. I became German champion with the under-19s in 2001 and 2002 – a first for Bayern.', 'You always need someone who takes on the ideas of others and enriches them with his own. Our Sacchi was Björn Andersson, who won the European Cup with Bayern in the 1970s. He didn’t treat us young players authoritatively, but at eye level. With this Scandinavian pedagogy, the Swede gave my generation a new style of leadership – flat hierarchies, discussion, participation.', 'Innovation never goes undetected. In different locations, other coaches adapted Sacchi, developed their own programmes, added their interpretation, formed great teams with continuity, dissolved Italy’s domination. For more than a quarter of a century, Alex Ferguson gave Manchester United stability, his side resembled an attacking machine. With his flair for character, he led them to the Champions League final four times, winning in 1999 and 2008.', 'Louis van Gaal captured the title in 1995 with Ajax, a club from a minor league with a history of attacking football. Ottmar Hitzfeld, a master of words and people management, won titles with Dortmund (1997) and Bayern (2001). Jupp Heynckes won with Real Madrid in 1998 and Bayern in 2013, Vicente del Bosque with Real in 2000 and 2002. Frank Rijkaard, title winner with Barcelona in 2006, was also a Sacchi player.', 'Then José Mourinho came along. His doctrine of modern catenaccio took the offensive spirit out of football. With underdogs Porto, he triumphed in the Uefa Cup in 2003 and the Champions League the following year. In the semi-final and final in 2004, the opponent failed to score. During this period, everyone was talking about playing against the ball.', 'Mourinho minimises the risk of conceding a goal. Thanks to a high level of organisation and physical strength, his teams achieve curious defensive feats. For example, he built a human barricade around the penalty area with Internazionale in the 2010 semi-final at Barcelona. His teams lie in wait for the ball to be lostand they use this moment of vulnerability to raid the goal with just a few moves. In 2010, in the final against Inter, our Bayern team was outplayed.', 'One of Mourinho’s champions is Diego Simeone. He has been directing Atlético Madrid to a finely tuned 11-man defence for 10 years. He has won the Europa League twice and recently secured the Spanish championship for the second time. Twice he has been in the final of the Champions League, when he lost narrowly. In 2014 and 2016 – that is, at a time when another era had long since dawned.', 'It was the heyday of possession. It went back to Pep Guardiola, who responded to Mourinho and rolled out Sacchi offensively. Guardiola attacked. He allowed the romantic ideology of total football, with which Cruyff had reached limits in the 90s, to grow into a new flower in Barcelona. He wanted complete control of the game, tying up the opponent in the attacking half and if the ball was ever lost, they were supposed to win it back in front.', 'That’s how you stifle the buildup of the others, a permanent offence is created. In the first leg of our 2009 quarter-final, Barcelona beat Bayern 4-0. In the 2009 and 2011 finals, Manchester United almost didn’t get the ball. Barça were overpowering.', 'It was epochal, born in Spain and therefore had an enormous impact on the national team, which was almost unbeatable at the time. Guardiola’s play with the ball then permeated international football.', 'Transitions are always fluid and great coaches find intermediate solutions. In the mid-2010s, Real Madrid dominated the Champions League, winning in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The biggest club in the world always attracts the best footballers. It would have taken a long search to strengthen the XI around Luka Modric, Ronaldo, Sergio Ramos, Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos.', 'But football is not just strategy, which brings us to another recent example: Jürgen Klopp. He answers Guardiola with passion, physicality, belief, anarchy and dynamic counterattacking. Klopp always finds an emotional connection with his players. His final appearance with Dortmund in 2013 was a strong performance. He advanced to the final twice with Liverpool, a citythat fits his mentality perfectly. In 2019, he won.', 'Sacchi, Mourinho and Guardiola – the ball-oriented operating system, playing with the ball and against it, total offence, lurking on the counterattack – all this will also be on display in Porto. Because no team currently has the dominance Milan had or that the Spaniards later had, all the top teams contain this three-part mixture, including the two finalists. Manchester City and Chelsea want to lay siege to their opponents in the penalty area and put them under pressure there with gegenpressing, but they also retreat again and again and leave the ball and initiative to them.', 'Both clubs have charismatic coaches. Guardiola’s style remains recognisable, but he borrows defensively from Mourinho because his team is not as regally put together as Real’s or Barça’s. Thomas Tuchel is the first coach to reach two finals in a row with two different clubs. He has found recognition among the 10 or so clubs that turnover between about €500m and €1bn a year and can compete internationally. This results in an approximate equality of forces. It will probably be an exciting final.', 'Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

It follows aborted discussions with the UK government over bringing the match to Wembley.', 'Both Chelsea and City are now immersing themselves in the necessary logistical planning that will make a short-notice overseas trip possible in the time of Covid. City have informed fans that packages of tickets and flights will be available to “qualified supporters”, though details are yet to be confirmed. But Portugal’s cabinet affairs minister, Mariana Vieira da Silva, said those attending would “come and return on the same day, with a test done, in a bubble situation, on charter flights”.', 'She added: “There will be two fan zones and from there they will be moved to the stadium and from the stadium to the airport, being in Portugal less than 24 hours. Obviously those coming by plane [to be in Porto while the match is on but do not actually go the stadium] will comply with the established rules and security measures will be put in place as happened in Lisbon last year.”', 'While the ultimate capacity of the final crowd is also still to be announced, further tickets will go on sale to the general public from 24 May. The question for fans hoping to travel, however, will be whether they can afford to buy a flight. On Thursday afternoon Easyjet’s lowest fare from London or Manchester to Porto on 28 May was £299. To return to Manchester on the day after the match would be another £419.', 'Hotel accommodation for two nights remains available starting from £250. Supporters who plan on travelling to Portugal will also be expected to record a negative PCR test result before leaving the UK.', 'Istanbul was originally due to host the final until the UK government placed Turkey on its travel red list last Friday. That would in effect have meant the match would have been played without supporters, forcing Uefa into having to contemplate a new venue. Wembley quickly became an alternative option after Boris Johnson said “it would be brilliant to host the game here if we can”. Ultimately several days of talks came to nothing as the UK failed to offer quarantine exemptions Uefa requested for the game.', 'In his remarks on announcing Porto as the new host, the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, made specific reference to those discussions. “We accept that the decision of the British government to place Turkey on the red list for travel was taken in good faith and in the best interests of protecting its citizens from the spread of the virus but it also presented us with a major challenge in staging a final featuring two English teams,” he said.', '“The difficulties of moving the final are great and the FA and the authorities made every effort to try to stage the match in England and I would like to thank them for their work in trying to make it happen.”', 'Ceferin added that he hoped the final would represent a positive moment in the passing of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I hope the final will be a symbol of hope at the re-emergence of Europe from a difficult period and that the fans who travel to the game will once again be able to lend their voices to showcase this final as the best in club football,” he said.']","Champions League","Sport","2021-05-13",11.32,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0dc3073174e205bc9b1f3a8bdd49e08b3c266d6/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=73b09f0f3847626b73d0dc4f3db9db3b","Porto’s Estádio do Dragão, where the Champions League final is due to be played.

Currently visitors from France and the Netherlands, among other countries, have to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon entering Portugal.', 'The UK government claimed that requests over quarantine waivers led to stalemate in discussions this week over moving the match to Wembley, after English fans had been banned from travelling to the original location of Istanbul.

  ["Manchester City v Chelsea: bravura final battle is held up by healthy bottom line","['These furiously evolving teams deserve their place in the final, but wealth of their owners and Premier League certainly helps']","['Les Anglais sont arrivés. Yes, it’s that time of the year again. The darling buds of May are, with all due sense of caution, beginning to bloom. And the Premier League is all set for its annual European away day.', 'First things first: the presence of two English clubs in the Champions League final is a source of huge pride and excitement for supporters of both teams. For Chelsea this is another high-water mark in the boom years, a season that has turned completely on its head after the rancour and impotence of midwinter. For longtime fans of Manchester City this represents a scarcely credible, beautifully executed journey’s end, more than a decade on from the complete making-over of the club.', 'There will be internal triumphalism for the Premier League and high fives in the committee rooms of the major UK rights holders. West London meets east Manchester in Istanbul – this is a bravura occasion for English sport, and reward for two genuinely captivating groups of players, brilliantly coached, and speckled with high-class homegrown product. Chelsea versus Manchester City, summer 2021, is all of these things. But it isn’t, in any sense, a surprise.', 'There are always phases in sport. The thing that is happening now is not the thing that will always happen. But the fact remains, right now, Premier League domination is the baseline. Five of the past eight Champions League finalists have been Premier League clubs.', 'And this is how it should be given the increasingly linear relationship between money and success. Five of the nine wealthiest clubs in the world operate in the Premier League. Two of those – Chelsea and City as it happens – are owned by sponsors with bottomless pockets, entities who aren’t in this business to make a profit, but for other, rather opaque and unexpressed reasons.', 'In a time of collapsing finances, City can comfortably maintain a £220m wage bill and pay Pep Guardiola £18m a year to apply his brilliance at the Eastlands campus. Where others feared financial collapse, Chelsea saw a sensible investment opportunity and gambled £200m on attacking talent, albeit much of it raked back in sales related to previous excess spending. lls sont les meilleurs! Sie sind die Besten! Yeah, well, all of that probably. But we’re back either way. And yet, this being football, the most gloriously resilient sporting substance, even this deeply familiar fixture looks fresh and moreish.', 'Istanbul will be the fourth time these teams have played each other in five months this calendar year. Both have evolved furiously in that time. City’s 3-1 win in January at Stamford Bridge was the launchpad for a shift towards the current pared-back winning machine, and a headline success for the false-nine system. Chelsea were in the process of ceasing to be Frank Lampard’s team. By the time these two met again in April for an FA Cup semi-final early Tuchel-ism had taken hold, that girdle of defensive strength strapped into place.', 'Victory on Saturday for City against Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium will seal the League title. But there are of course major subplots here now, a game of bluff and mental edge before that final in three weeks’ time. It is a good match-up, too. Both managers are drawn, as a first principle, towards keeping the ball. Both have experimented this season with deep, resilient defence. There is a narrative around both teams that their attacking patterns – intricate and technical versus high-speed transition – are let down by the lack of a classic rapier finisher.', '1972 Uefa Cup: Tottenham 3-2 Wolves', \"The first all-English final was almost 50 years ago. Spurs won 2-1 at Molineux in the first leg, Martin Chivers scoring both goals. Alan Mullery put Tottenham further ahead in the second leg, and they held on despite Dave Wagstaffe's equaliser at White Hart Lane.\", '2008 Champions League: Man Utd 1-1 Chelsea (6-5 pens)', \"The slip seen around the world, as John Terry missed the chance to seal Chelsea's first Champions League title in the penalty shootout. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's penalty to seal United's third European Cup. The game finished 1-1 after 120 minutes in Moscow, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard scoring the goals.\\xa0\", '2019 Europa League: Chelsea 4-1 Arsenal', \"This London derby in Azerbaijan was won decisively by Chelsea, who took the lead through former Gunner Olivier Giroud. Eden Hazard scored twice and set up Pedro for Chelsea's fourth, with Alex Iwobi grabbing a consolation goal as Arsenal missed out on a Champions League place.\", '2019 Champions League: Liverpool 2-0 Tottenham', \"Another all-Premier League affair in 2019, as Liverpool won their sixth European Cup in Madrid, a year on from losing the final to Real Madrid. Mo Salah put Liverpool ahead from the penalty spot after two minutes, but it wasn't until Divock Origi (pictured) got a late second goal that Jürgen Klopp's side could celebrate. PA\", 'This is a little old school in itself. Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel don’t set up without an orthodox centre‑forward because of some kind of oversight or failure of recruitment. They want to play this way, to score in this way, to prioritise other patterns. And for all the reservations (where is their Niall Quinn, their Kerry Dixon?) City are top scorers in the Premier League, while Chelsea have 14 in six Champions League away games. They missed a lot of chances against Paris Saint‑Germain and Real Madrid. But this also involved making a lot of chances.', 'The final will be fascinating for other reasons. Both managers are interventionists and details merchants. There will be a game of tactical feint and counter-feint. The assumption might be that this will suit Tuchel, who after all reached the Champions League final last year and who has a reputation for succeeding in these managerial two-handers.', 'But there is also a misconception about Guardiola, overthinking and the “bottling” of one-off games. It seems fair to suggest the reason Guardiola has been vulnerable on these occasions is systemic rather than a failing of personality. His style is a league style, not a knockout style. His methods are not geared towards one-off collisions, where intuitive moves, emotion, or being able to snatch the day can decide the contest.', 'Guardiola creates a system, a machine for winning, something that will over a season operate at a pitch that is impossible to match. This will occasionally be derailed by opponents who are equally able and who have a gameplan that can pick away at a Guardiola team’s strengths. Perhaps Tuchel will look to exploit João Cancelo’s tendency to roam inside, as he did in the FA Cup game. Perhaps Guardiola will counter, as he did against PSG, by rejigging his full-backs. It may or may not work. But this is not some fatal flaw, or evidence of bald fraudulism. Every way of winning has its weak point.', 'The base position remains the same, though. The Premier League is dominant because it is the richest football environment in the world. City are the best team in that league by some distance, an amalgam of squad depth, supreme organisation and the resources to make that vision work. They should be comfortable favourites to win this game.', 'After which, well, what exactly? Both of these teams occupy a strange space in the operatic wranglings of Big Football. Here we have two founder members of the Super League, a failed assassination of Uefa’s grand old show, now queuing up to waggle that cup around on top of a podium in era-defining glory.', 'Both were quick to backtrack when the whole thing fell apart – shocked to find this was, in fact, a terrible PR move. But then, joining it was always a weird personal choice given reputation, fame, soft blurry feelings of love – whatever – is the reason these owners are in the game in the first place, as opposed to making a few quid.', 'This is the broader, noisier subtext to an all-English final. The Super League was, above all, an attack on the Premier League’s primacy. It was an attack by billionaires on other, more powerful billionaires. This match-up, Istanbul 2021, England versus England, is another pointer to why it happened; and why it is almost certainly coming back.']","Champions League","Sport","2021-05-06",20.45,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/580a42694e82363ce762e5441b2f53e0e17316d0/0_65_3841_2304/master/3841.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d6caeeea727dfa5bf9b1fd417755a6d9","Ben Chilwell tackles João Cancelo in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

Questions such as: just how good are Bayern Munich? How bad, exactly, is almost everyone else? And can we just fast forward to the bit where Bayern and Liverpool finally get to pile into one another like a pair of peak-career Mexican middleweights?', 'Bayern erected another milestone on Tuesday at the Red Bull Arena, extending their record Champions League winning run to 14 games with a startlingly open 6-2 shellacking of RB Salzburg.', 'Steamrollering runs of form have become a feature of European club football as talent and wealth is hoarded ever more closely. This, though, is something distinct. Bayern will head into Der Klassiker on Saturday on the back of nine straight wins, plus five trophies won in the past five months. Two things stand out about this supremacy. First, it has come from something close to a standing start. Bayern sacked the gloom-ridden Niko Kovac last November. Since then the same group of players has won 11 games straight in the Champions League, including an entire shortened knockout stage, by an aggregate score of 42-7.', 'Second, and more striking, is the style of their dominance, just how beautifully well-suited that merciless front-foot game of sprints is to the current seasick state of European football.

Teams have not been built, plans have not been laid. Some of these alleged champion teams resemble a collapsed souffle, oozing at the edges, soft in the middle, basic shape just about recognisable.', 'There is a paradox here. The football may be fan-free and played to order, an uncomfortably synthetic spectacle. But it is also entertaining as a TV product, and perversely authentic in some ways. Here, finally, we get a rare glimpse at times of heavily conditioned elite players performing off the cuff.', 'It is a kind of looseness that suits Bayern’s strengths and it was there very clearly on Tuesday in a Group B fixture that resembled something from a more carefree era, a galloping, cavalry officer kind of sport.', 'Bayern and Salzburg took 39 shots at goal. There were overturned penalties, shots against the post, a thrilling goal from Serge Gnabry ruled out by offside. Bayern scored four times in 11 minutes at the end as Leroy Sané and Douglas Costa entered a pitch drowning in lactic acid. Before then, though, Salzburg passed the ball with fizz and zip, Dominik Szoboszlai a constant menace, and often found space behind the Bayern defence.', 'This is the paradox of Bayern and the allure of their style. The advantages of blitzing midfield and relentlessly crowding opponents are deemed greater than the risks of pushing high in defence and relying on the odd burst of recovery speed.', 'It is a robust, concussive style and one that seems ideally suited to lockdown football. Bayern want to tear you apart in the opening 10 minutes, then tear you apart all over again for the remaining 80. But their methods are quite linear, based on rapid movement, clear passing lines and by a team without technical or physical weak links.', 'Bayern don’t just pass the ball, they spank it about at fearsome speed, shaving off touches taken and time in static possession. If the Spanish passing style feels like watching something being mercilessly unpicked, this is a constant battering at the hinges, a sustained blowing off of the doors.', 'It has been suggested the more careful, high-maintenance passing rhythms of a classic Pep Guardiola team will be hard to drill in the current schedule. Whereas Bayern, like Liverpool, have a less complex, more obviously repeatable set of movements, concerned as much with speed of execution as the carefully wrought manipulation of space.', 'It is an Anglo-German (or rather German-German) comparison worth making. If only because this is the match-up European football seems to be leaning towards. Liverpool and Bayern cannot meet until March. Plenty can change before then. But on the evidence of the last year these are not just the two leading teams, but a fascinating prospect in opposition.', 'Liverpool were wonderfully surgical in attack in the 5-0 defeat of Atlanta on Tuesday, albeit against brutally outclassed opponents. Goals three and five basically involved Liverpool players running unhindered from halfway to score.', 'More striking was the way Diogo Jota’s diagonal runs found pockets of space behind a high defensive line, a reminder that Liverpool’s most convincing attacking rhythms are geared towards exploiting this kind of defensive shape. Bayern have played like this, and won like this, for the past 12 months, taking a risk to feed a strength. In a time of confusion the two most coherent teams in Europe look an excellent world title match-up.', 'The football may feel unplanned, off the cuff and even oddly liberated.

I don’t understand the criticism.”', 'Liverpool face what Klopp described as “the biggest challenge in the Champions League” so far on Tuesday when they visit last season’s quarter-finalists Atalanta in Bergamo. Gian Piero Gasperini’s team scored 98 goals in Serie A last season, the highest total in Italy’s top flight for more than 60 years, and Klopp believes there are comparisons between their style and Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds.', 'Klopp, who has Joël Matip, Naby Keïta and Kostas Tsimikas back in training after injury, said: “Atalanta are very special in their approach, slightly similar to Leeds. Top players, top recruitment, very well organised, play their system with 100% conviction; they know exactly what everyone has to do and use the skills of individuals in incredibly smart ways.', '“You can see [Alejandro] Gómez in midfield, a completely free, floating genius and they make it very difficult to catch him. There has been some impressive developments of players. They have a lot of these kind of stories and in the team there is a really good atmosphere and a good mood.', '“Their last season was a good one and we know how difficult the season was for everyone in Bergamo [because of the coronavirus pandemic]. They dealt with the situation and I respect that. I know how good they are. I enjoyed analysing them because it is really interesting and if you see something interesting you should try to learn a little bit from it. It will be a tough one.”', 'Liverpool are top of their Champions League group with a 100% record and have also risen to the Premier League summit since the setbacks of losing 7-2 at Aston Villa and Virgil van Dijk’s injury. Trent Alexander-Arnold admits the champions were “humbled” by that emphatic defeat at Villa Park but have rediscovered their focus as a result.', '“It was about self-reflection in that period [after Villa] and knowing that can’t happen,” the defender said. “It was kind of a one-off. To concede seven goals is unacceptable but it is about learning from these things. It kind of humbled us as a team and it let us know we can’t just win games because we are Liverpool with the history of the club and the players we’ve got. It is about mentality and the work we put in. If we are not at 100% these things can happen.', '“It wasn’t an outrageously bad performance but our mentality wasn’t there on the day and we got punished. Since then we have been really able to focus on that and looking back on the last two years especially, it is our mentality that has got us to where we are now. ', '“It has enabled us to come back from any position, to break through walls and kick down doors in that respect. Since that game we have been able to get back into that stride.”']","Mohamed Salah","Sport","2020-11-02",15.28,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f55cccd18f36730fc23f670c6bee95749b32a14/0_148_1530_918/master/1530.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d7cb25c247b4aef6e662002d67d2a025","Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah had three marks on his foot from the West Ham game and ‘one of them is from the penalty situation’.

Rashford may have been making most of his headlines off the pitch in recent weeks and Fernandes finding himself a member of a rather crowded selection panel for midfield, but the pair are United’s leading goal scorers this season.', 'Resting Rashford left United with only Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood up front, almost a return to a 4-4-2 formation, except that neither of the forward attacking options operated as a central sharp edge in front of goal.', 'Resting Fernandes allowed Solskjær to give Donny van de Beek some time on the pitch, the former Ajax player’s virtual invisibility in Premier League games having attracted comment and criticism after a £35m transfer, but without the Portugal international’s energy and invention behind the front two, United began looking conservative and oddly unthreatening.', 'Paul Scholes, working as a pundit and putting his finger on the point as usual, said it looked as though they were playing away from home. True enough, but without the usual 75,000 crowd offering encouragement and partisan fervour, is home advantage even relevant any longer?', 'Leipzig, by the same token, were supposed to be playing away, yet an empty Old Trafford is hardly the full European experience. Not so much Theatre of Dreams as undercooked cauldron of caution. The snazziest thing by far about the German side was the excessively loud jacket worn by their manager Julian Nagelsmann, a stripy acid-blue number that was practically alone among the visitors in sparkling under the lights.', 'It might be remembered that José Mourinho first made a name for himself by attracting attention when celebrating a Porto win at this stadium, though even the soon-to-be special one was dressed more demurely in a dark blue coat.', 'On the pitch, Van de Beek was tidy and efficient without suggesting he deserves a regular slot ahead of Paul Pogba or Nemanja Matic. At least he was kept on when the latter was withdrawn after an hour, but only to appreciate he also faces competition from Fred and Scott McTominay. As Solskjær keeps emphasising, he is not short of options in midfield, and the questions about where Van de Beek would fit in surfaced when he signed, not simply after a few weeks of bench warming.', 'The consensus in summer was that Van de Beek was a signing for the future, possibly an insurance against Pogba departing at some point, though until Fernandes came on with 20 minutes to go there was no doubt Pogba was the most influential of the home midfield pack.', 'Greenwood’s finish for the opening goal was characteristically crisp and accurate, but the ball to his feet from Pogba was what cut the visitors’ defence apart. Pogba almost did it again in the second half with an imaginative pass that invited Martial to break his goal drought, only to find his fellow French international could not quite summon a finish to match Greenwood’s.', 'In all probability one goal would have been enough for United, Leipzig never really looked like getting back on terms even after bringing on a couple of attacking substitutes, but in further bad news for Van de Beek his manager sent on first Fernandes then Rashford for the later stages.', 'He had only been on the pitch for a few minutes when Fernandes found him with an instinctive pass into space, one that Rashford not only collected but wisely went on to put away, important when VAR overruled the referee’s assistant who failed to spot he was still in his own half when the ball was played.', 'Within minutes Rashford would again finish impeccably when Fred won the ball just outside the Leipzig area, then magnanimously eschew the chance of a hat-trick by allowing Martial to claim a goal from the penalty spot. No problem – the striker was able to pounce again in stoppage time – proving that not only is he a hero for our times with confidence levels verging on the stratospheric, he can do a decent impersonation of what his manager used to get up to back in the day.', 'Rashford’s emphatic contribution after entering the fray on 62 minutes suggested Solskjær knew exactly what he was keeping in reserve, and though the United manager has not had everything his own way in the Premier League thus far, in Europe it is impossible to argue with another win in Paris followed by a 5-0 leathering of the form side in the Bundesliga.', 'Solskjær’s stock is on the rise again, whereas long before the end, Nagelsmann could be seen trying to hide his beacon of a blazer behind the brickwork of the visitors’ dugout.']","Manchester United","Sport","2020-10-29",8.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98978b3fb4d3a1415ba4fea561cab358ef73d8f6/0_77_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ab5c711e734eb8236c8498c906b914f2","Marcus Rashford gets a pat on the back from his Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, after his three goals against RB Leipzig.

Leon Goretzka doubled Bayern’s lead five minutes before half-time as Hansi Flick’s side defied predictions of a close battle between the two Group A heavyweights.', 'Corentin Tolisso made sure of victory in spectacular fashion midway through the second half. After a free-kick was cleared, the midfielder struck an unstoppable effort into Jan Oblak’s top corner from 30 yards out. Coman added his second of the night, finishing off a sweeping counter attack by sliding the ball inside the far post.', '“Our game was just good tonight,” Flick said after the game. “It was a tough task but we mastered it. Our efficiency was good today and I am very satisfied. It is very important to win that first game. We had a match plan and we applied it, playing out four beautiful goals.”', 'In Group A’s early game, Red Bull Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow drew 2-2 in Austria. Eder put the visitors ahead early on, before Dominik Szoboszlai equalised on the stroke of half-time with a ferocious long-range strike. Salzburg took a second-half lead through Zlatko Junuzovic, but Vitali Lisakovich’s far-post header meant the spoils were shared.', 'Romelu Lukaku rescued Internazionale with a late equaliser at home against Borussia Mönchengladbach, who thought they had caused a second Group B shock of the night after Shakhtar Donetsk’s 3-2 win at Real Madrid.', 'Lukaku fired Inter ahead just after half-time, but the visitors levelled when Arturo Vidal was penalised for fouling Marcus Thuram in the area. Ramy Bensebaini converted the penalty, before Jonas Hofmann finished a clinical counter attack in the 84th minute. With time running out, Lukaku bundled home from a corner to earn Antonio Conte’s side a valuable point before their trip to Ukraine next Tuesday.', 'Atalanta showed Liverpool they will offer competition for top spot in Group D by beating Midtjylland 4-0.

Yet at the Gewiss Stadium Varane was forced off in the first half and Solskjær said: “It’s a hamstring and I didn’t want to take a risk. On the first assessment it doesn’t look good but we will assess him again tomorrow.”', 'As United’s defence was again a problem against Gian Piero Gasperini’s side the loss of Varane, for what might be a number of weeks, would be a setback.', 'Solskjær, though, praised the “incredible” Cristiano Ronaldo after he was again United’s saviour when equalising twice – in added time of the first and second half – to earn what might prove an invaluable draw.', 'It means United head Group F with seven points on goal difference from Villarreal with the Spanish club and Young Boys left to play. Ronaldo’s fourth and fifth strikes of the phase cancelled out Josip Illicic’s opener and Duván Zapata’s second, which had each given Atalanta the lead.', 'Solskjær brushed off any concern that United are too reliant on the 36-year-old forward. “We all have our roles and responsibilities,” the Norwegian said. “Cristiano is a leader in the group, he scores goals. I’m sure Chicago Bulls didn’t mind having Michael Jordan, either – sometimes the teams have the players they have and that’s why they are Manchester United, Chicago Bulls, you come up with those moments.', '“Cristiano is getting better and better for us, he’s feeling better and up to speed now – he didn’t have a full pre-season.

  ["'It's lovely to be here': county cricket fans return to the Oval","['First trial of fans returning to live sport since Covid-19 shutdown']","['It was only 10.30 on a quiet Sunday morning in Kennington, south London, but the beers were already flowing. And for good reason.', 'After four months of cardboard cutouts warming the seats of silent stadiums across the UK, spectators finally returned in the flesh to sport for a friendly county cricket fixture between Surrey and Middlesex at the Oval.“It has been the highlight of the lockdown, as it were,” said Neil Fraser, who attended alongside his partner, Jenny. “This has been something that I’ve missed – we’ve been waiting for cricket to come back and this is the first time we have been out in the whole time.”They were two among an exclusive and fortunate group. Surrey county cricket club boasts 13,500 members and the Oval, its home ground, has a capacity of 25,500, yet just 1,000 seats were available. Surrey Cricket had been uncertain about the number of fans who would even be interested, but on Wednesday morning the dozen staff members manning the phones were overwhelmed by 10,000 calls placed in the first hour alone.“I rang quite a few times, got horrible lift music for half an hour,” said John, a 15-year-long club member from Chelmsford, Essex. “I complained a bit, and that worked. At 3 o’clock I got through. Ten thousand calls in the first hour! I don’t know how I got a ticket in the end.”', 'By midday, most fans had arrived and they were sequestered in the cosy 1845 stand, separated two seats apart in each row and with every other row of seats left vacant. After months of artificial background noise at sporting events, even the smallest facets of a real, live crowd were to be cherished: the spontaneous oohs after a peachy cover drive, the volume of applause rising and falling according to the crowd’s enthusiasm in the moment. Even the ambient chatter felt like a positive feature rather than an annoyance in these strange times. Another sign of life.', 'Those who made the trip left their fears behind, but the walkways of the Oval were still a microcosm of a society that does not agree. As fans trickled in, some marked their arrival by tearing their masks from their faces and they insisted on speaking with voices unmuffled. Others rushed to ensure that their masks were tightly fastened as soon as they noticed this journalist approaching.Sue, a member since her retirement four years ago, aligned firmly into the former camp. Asked if she was at all wary of being among people again, she immediately shook her head.“Not in the slightest,” she said. “I couldn’t wait to get here. I’ve been out and about as and when I’ve been allowed to. Throughout the whole process, I made a point of going out every day, walking a lot.', '“[Lockdown] started frightening, then I got very angry. Just the whole frustration of it all. We’re not used to it, are we? Not used to being told what to do.”', 'Throughout the day, fans acted sensibly, keeping their distance in the crowd and beyond. Richard Gould, Surrey’s chief executive, suggested that club members were even more incentivised to be reasonable in order to ensure that they could return once more. As they told stories of their affinity to the Oval, many seemed to agree. One fan, who did not wish to be named, likened his return to “coming home”.', 'Another, Natalia, explained that she moved to Britain a decade ago. When she recently reapplied for her work visa, her host family provided a testimony in her application.“One of the reasons we put for why she should have her work visa renewed is because she has become assimilated to British culture and has a membership at Surrey. I think that went a long way into renewing her permit,” said Christine, her host mother, laughing.Still, this spectacle was not simply to please fans. As the government sets into motion its optimistic plans to bring audiences back to stadiums in October, this marked the first test. Members of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport were on hand to watch as the day unfolded. Further tests follow next week at the world snooker championship and the Goodwood horse racing festival.Gould asserted that with 100 staff on hand to just 1,000 spectators, not even a 30% capacity of the entire stadium would be financially viable. Attendance accounts for 90% of Surrey Cricket’s annual £3m matchday revenue and it is currently also missing out on the £6m usually generated from conferences and events at the facilities. His view of a sporting world without sufficient crowds for too long is bleak.“We need to be back to normal next summer,” Gould said. “If we’re not back to normal next summer, the structure, not just of our sport but all sports, will need to change.”As they returned to watch the sport they love in person, such concerns were far from the minds of the fans. They were too busy soaking in the view once more.', '“On a hot summer’s day, there is nothing nicer than sitting and watching cricket,” said John of Chelmsford. “Even if it’s boring as hell, it’s still lovely to be here.”']","Cricket","Sport","2020-07-26",18.49,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3220dc6146d27db43e6c5cf9807707f9091f13/0_218_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=07cf7ad013c2e0e49dc0ad8e3fa7af4d","Just 1000 spectator seats were available for the Surrey v Middlesex friendly match at the Oval.

But according to reports Surrey, MCC (Lord’s), Lancashire and Warwickshire are proposing to host a crunched-down finish to the IPL in the UK during the second half of September. It is an ambitious idea given the sheer volume of cricketers and support staff required to travel and quarantine, even factoring in that India’s Test players would already be in the country.', 'An ECB spokesperson said: “We speak to the BCCI regularly about tours and other matters and we’ll continue doing so, but we have received no indication that they are looking for alternative hosts for the IPL at the moment.”', 'Meanwhile New Zealand have confirmed Trent Boult will miss the first Test against England at Lord’s next month and possibly the second at Edgbaston following a request to fly home and see his family after the IPL’s collapse.

  ["IPL plays on as BCCI’s cash cow while India’s Covid-19 crisis worsens","['With players withdrawing and the death toll spiralling, the financial justification is all that is keeping the show going']","['At what point during a global pandemic do you ask yourself: must the show go on? The Indian Premier League is now near that point as the action moves to Delhi, the nation’s capital, and Ahmedabad, the new cricket capital. Both are locations that continue to be severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'England’s Liam Livingstone, the Australians Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson, and, perhaps most significant, India’s Ravichandran Ashwin have all left the 2021 IPL for Covid-related reasons. While some of those players withdrew citing the difficulty of the biosecure-bubble life, and others because they did not want to be stuck in a foreign country as their homelands began to shut down borders, Ashwin’s departure is particularly relevant.', 'On Sunday I asked Ashwin, on Twitter, if he had considered staying at home, given this was the advice he was dispensing to his 10.3 million followers, and was met with a barrage of abuse from the cricketer’s followers and fans.', 'Not long afterwards, Ashwin announced, via the same medium: “I would be taking a break from this year’s IPL from tomorrow. My family and extended family are putting up a fight against #COVID19 and I want to support them during these tough times. I expect to return to play if things go in the right direction.”', 'Ashwin has always been a cricketer who sees the bigger picture and, though the details behind his decision have not been disclosed, it is unlikely to have been made independently from the startling numbers in the public domain. Since this edition of the IPL began on 9 April nearly 30,000 people have lost their lives in India to Covid-19, according to official figures. If anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, the number of deaths caused by the virus might be exponentially higher.', 'There is a severe shortage of medication, oxygen, hospital beds and even cremation facilities in major cities across India. The system is at breaking point. On Sunday, the seven-day average of active cases stood at 321,263, with daily new positives in excess of 350,000. If these were the official numbers and the IPL was being staged in the UK, it would have already been shut down. The last edition of the IPL, played in the United Arab Emirates, would have suffered a similar fate.', 'But in India things work differently. There are certain cash cows that cannot be criticised, but even more protected are the holy cows, such as the IPL. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is run by Jay Shah, the secretary, and he reports not so much to the president of the BCCI, Sourav Ganguly, the former India captain, as to Amit Shah, the home minister of India and one of most powerful men in the country. Jay also happens to be Amit’s son.', 'This works well on a practical level, in that the BCCI has been able to create a biosecure bubble for perhaps the only domestic tournament in the world that can afford it across two months and many cities. The BCCI has also been able to secure privileges from the government of India, such as having separate check-in counters and security corridors in airports for the players and others in the IPL.', 'England not ordering IPL players home', \"England will continue to leave the participation of their players in the Indian Premier League down to personal choice despite growing unease at the tournament's continuation during the country's Covid-19 crisis.\", 'Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali, Dawid Malan, Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes, Tom and Sam Curran and Sam Billings are still at their respective franchises, with no immediate withdrawals currently expected.', 'Flying home would involve a 10-day quarantine in a government hotel upon arrival back in the UK after India was added to the government\\'s \"red list\", while the IPL\\'s biosecure arrangements are seemingly holding firm at present.\\xa0', 'With Sourav Ganguly, the BCCI president, quoted on Monday saying the IPL is \"going on as scheduled\", England\\'s approach remains to monitor the situation as regards player welfare and assist with any logistical queries that arise.', 'An England spokesperson said: \"We continue to monitor and work with the players on an individual basis. We are offering advice daily to those that seek it. Our thoughts are with the people of India during these difficult times.\" Ali Martin', 'What has been in focus during recent IPL matches is the presence at many grounds of invitees of the teams or the IPL – who have sometimes masked up and at other times not – while essential allied services, such as a neutral media reporting these games as events and beyond, were shut out.', 'On Sunday, the IPL broadcast included public service messages such as masking up and maintaining social distancing, something that had been all too absent from the time the tournament began. This had to happen. The manner in which it was solely celebrating entertainment and glory during its nightly four-hour televised pockets, while a nation outside gasped for breath and begged for life-saving medication, was tone deaf and, frankly, unsustainable.', 'But then as a public exercise, the IPL has always been remarkably good at reinventing itself.', 'And the signs are that those working on the tournament – most significantly the live broadcast – have been given the go-ahead to actually speak about something other than maximums and the latest features of the sponsored SUV on display.', 'There is also an argument that the IPL’s continuation keeps its vast audience indoors at home every evening and provides a window of normality during what is an unprecedented crisis.', 'Ultimately, however, its continuation comes down to money. The IPL generates a significant proportion of Indian cricket’s revenues – estimated at £318m this year – and this will defray expenses incurred in the last 18 months.', 'Domestic players, coaches, support staff and countless others who rely on seasonal cricket wages are waiting to be paid. The BCCI can afford to do so but only if the show goes on, it insists.', 'If it does continue, however, the results had better match the positive intentions.

  ["Ruqsana Begum: 'My story is bigger than boxing'","['The former Muay Thai world champion on arranged marriage, chronic fatigue syndrome, gym bullies and early wobbles in boxing']","['The tears of Ruqsana Begum, which splash down on the blue canvas of the ring, are not a sign of weakness. They are, instead, markers of the battles she has won over the years. As a young Bangladeshi woman from east London on her way to becoming a Muay Thai world champion, Begum endured an arranged marriage, panic attacks, depression, bullying in the gym and ravaging bouts of ME [chronic fatigue syndrome].', 'She cries during our long interview on a hazy summer afternoon in Bethnal Green but never loses her composure. Each time the former kickboxing dynamo wipes away her tears, laughs a little while saying sorry, and continues. “Those moments have led me to this moment,” she says after one poignant pause, “where I now manage to not look for approval from outside. Rather, I go inwards and find strength from within.”', 'Begum reiterates her passion for fighting and her certainty that she can still become a success in her new sport of boxing despite the odds stacked against her. “I do love it. Stepping into the ring allows you to grow because you’re putting yourself in such depths of fear. And when you overcome that there’s such a sense of accomplishment. I love that and the fact I’m constantly working towards my goal, and progressing, even if I sometimes lose.”', 'She is a petite 36-year-old, a warm and reflective woman who also has a degree in architecture. At 5ft 3in, she does not look like a fighter. And so it’s strange, at first, to reconcile the fact that the violent backdrop of Muay Thai and boxing have brought serenity into Begum’s often turbulent world.', '“I think any creative art form, whether music or dance, Muay Thai or boxing, allows you to channel emotion and express yourself,” she says. “I was fortunate to have discovered Thai boxing when I had few other opportunities to express myself. I found my passion in life and realised I was good at it. But it’s like anything in life – talent is nothing without sacrifice.', '“So when I had all those problems I didn’t blame others. I took responsibility and said: ‘OK, this is where I am. How do I move forward?’ I found the best way to heal myself is through sport. So I’m really grateful for having Muay Thai and now boxing in my life.”', 'Begum’s new book, Born Fighter, provides an absorbing insight into the obstacles she faced. It is written with Sarah Shephard and the two women, from Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, complement each other as we learn how Begum hid her passion for Thai boxing from her family for many years. She was torn between her desire to be a dutiful Muslim daughter and a darker yearning to discover her real self in the ring.', 'The KO Combat Academy, where much of the book is set, is located under an arch in a backstreet of Bethnal Green. Trains clatter overhead and it makes me think how intimidating it must have been for a teenage Bangladeshi girl to approach a gym. “The original gym was across the road,” Begum explains, “and I can’t believe I had the courage to walk in. This is now more a commercial gym whereas back then it was hardcore. It was just fighters.”', 'Bill Judd, who trained Begum to her world championship, welcomes us today. He was just as accepting, if initially surprised, when the 18-year-old Begum told him she wanted to be a fighter. She could cover the bruises on her arms and legs, which she took from kicks, but she became adept at avoiding blows to her face. And when she was marked up her sister helped her hide the damage or she pulled her hijab more closely around her face.', 'Five years later Begum was forced to abandon Muay Thai. She was coerced into an arranged marriage by her family – who meant well in adhering to the traditions of their culture. “I was 23 and it was overwhelming,” Begum recalls. “I thought: ‘Whoa, I need to take a breath because I don’t even know him.’ I felt so much pressure to go along with it so I tried to speak to my mum. She waved me away and was very dismissive. They made it clear this was going to happen.”', 'Begum stresses that her husband, a banker from east London, was not a monster. Her book’s most harrowing pages detail how she felt trapped and suffocated living with her husband’s family who expected her to do so many chores on their behalf. “I was oppressed,” she says. “I didn’t have that freedom to say: ‘I’m feeling a bit tired so I’ll do the washing in an hour.’ I was constantly trying to please them but whatever I did wasn’t enough. At the same time I’d started a high-pressure job as a trainee architect. Eventually it took a toll on me.”', 'Begum details the severe panic attacks which engulfed her after nine months. Her doctor advised her to move back to her parents. She was in a terrible state and only the eventual understanding of her parents stabilised her. What would have happened if they had insisted she return to her marriage? “I would have stood my ground and said no. But it would have been a battle to find the courage and strength – especially when I was very vulnerable. My father was in two minds. But my mum and older brother were like: ‘No, she has to go back. This is the tradition.’ I tried to explain it to my father after one of my therapy sessions. And his reaction wasn’t good. But at that point my ex-husband filed for divorce and I was thinking: ‘God, it’s the biggest relief.’ My parents understood then what I had been through.', '“I was on antidepressants for four months and completely bedridden. But I didn’t want to be on antidepressants because they numb you. The only thing I remembered enjoying was Muay Thai and so I told myself: ‘Get back to the gym.’ One day I asked my parents to drop me off when they were coming to Whitechapel to shop. I then said: ‘Actually, can you come in with me?’ I introduced them to Bill.”', 'The trainer outlined the discipline of the sport and stressed how Begum was so respectful, and respectable, in the gym. Her parents agreed she could return. But new problems soon emerged. Begum cries when she tells me how she was bullied by other female fighters at the gym.', '“It went on for five years and Bill kept saying to me: ‘Why don’t you just leave and go to another gym?’ I thought: ‘No. I don’t want to be pushed out.’ Bill hated it but his focus was on that group of girls. I wish he supported me more because I just wanted equal treatment. So it really broke my heart and that’s why I’m torn about this place. I’ve had some amazing moments here but also a lot of pain.”', 'Begum shocked everyone in 2011 by becoming a European champion in Latvia without having anyone in her corner. A Danish trainer in the crowd ran to help her when he saw Begum was on her own between rounds.', 'Over the next few years Judd worked more closely with Begum and helped her become a world champion kickboxer in 2016. In the week of her defining fight against Susanna Salmijärvi, her ME was so debilitating that Begum was stunned when she passed a medical to fight. “I was bed-bound the whole week so I said to Bill: ‘I’m too weak to even do a warm-up. Just put me in the ring. If anything happens, throw in the towel. But give me the first round so I have those two minutes to try and knock her out. This is an opportunity I’ll never get again.’ I had enough energy for two minutes which could define the rest of my life.”', 'She came close to an early knockout but her opponent got up and, at the end of a brutal fight, Begum absorbed sustained punishment. She had done just enough to become world champion and, as she says now, “It was a 10-year journey and my first thought was: ‘Thank you, God.’”', 'Her parents surprised her when they did not resist her decision to accept an offer from David Haye to switch to professional boxing in 2018. It has been difficult for Begum and she has only had two bouts as a pro boxer – both against Ivanka Ivanova. The first fight was a draw and then, in June 2019, she was hurt badly and lost a decision to her Bulgarian opponent.', '“She didn’t hurt me in the first fight and so I was shocked the second time. There was just something unusual about her that night. When I hit her there was no reaction. That freaks me out because I’ve sparred with some boys, and good pros, in Vegas. I’ve made their noses bleed and if I hit someone there’s always some reaction. But there was nothing like that in our second fight. She was like a zombie.', '“It didn’t help that she elbowed me in the first 30 seconds and my eye completely closed. Everyone wanted me to give up afterwards but I’ve followed my gut. It’s a learning curve and the only problem with boxing is that once you lose your unbeaten record it’s meant to be over. And it’s far harder being a female boxer because there are no journeywomen. Any woman that goes into boxing is a serious fighter because they wouldn’t get signed otherwise.”', 'The Covid crisis has made it even more difficult but Begum is convinced she will become a world champion boxer. She is in talks with promoters in the US and says: “I’m hopeful. I feel like my story is bigger than boxing and these challenges will make me a better fighter and a better person. For me it’s nothing new. I’ve already gone through so many challenges in a different sport and in my life.”', 'The world outside is reeling and we have our masks at the ready before we leave the gym. But it feels right that this born fighter should stretch out her hand and bump her fist lightly against mine. “Phew, it was emotional,” she says simply as she reflects on the story of her life, “but it was good.”', 'Born Fighter by Ruqsana Begum is published by Simon & Schuster']","Boxing","Sport","2020-07-29",10,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ed035534696c561b4efb885f91290d26c575d0/721_539_5421_3253/master/5421.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&fit=max&s=8cfcf0a0eb469d69a64c0fd542a6aa3a","Ruqsana Begum says she ‘can’t believe I had the courage to walk in’ to the KO Combat Academy as an 18-year-old.

Hearn’s fighter, Anthony Joshua, faces Pulev on Saturday night in the first world heavyweight title contest to take place in a bio-secure Covid-19 bubble. The curiously open and engaging nature of boxing, the most brutal and dangerous of all sports, has been even more evident this week as the fighters, managers, promoters, television crews and lowly writers have all been cooped up together in a cordoned-off section of a hotel in Wembley.', '“He’s scary,” Hearn continued after I told him how Pulev had been a quiet revelation whether talking about books or his father, psychology or his conviction that he will beat Joshua. “Every time I’ve seen him this week I’ve gone like that.”', 'Hearn bunched his knuckles in the traditional fist bump of the fight bubble. “And Pulev’s really hit me quite hard on the hand. Not violently but I’ve gone [Hearn wrings his hand]. I said: ‘Kubrat, can you stop doing that?’ He looked at me and said: ‘Ha, ha, you easy …’”', 'Hearn has hundreds of millions of pounds hinging on the outcome of this fight. If Pulev were to shock Joshua and strip him of his IBF, WBA and WBO belts he will simultaneously rip up Hearn’s intricate plans. An expected victory for the champion, in contrast, would secure a two-fight deal between Joshua and Tyson Fury, the WBC title-holder. Joshua against Fury, an all-British battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, would be a wild, compelling and insanely lucrative affair. Hearn expects the first fight to secure around 2.2m buys on pay-per-view.', 'Pulev stands in the way – but the Bulgarian’s toughness is not matched by the kind of hand speed which unsettled Joshua when he was stopped 18 months ago. Andy Ruiz Jr, dismissed as a roly-poly no-hoper, hauled himself off the Madison Square Garden canvas to blitz Joshua. The fallen champion looked battered and bemused on that crazy night in New York.', 'It says much for Joshua’s professionalism that he won the rematch in Saudi Arabia last December by opting for a more cautious strategy. He regained his titles with a wide victory on points but doubts remain because Ruiz partied harder than he prepared for that second fight – and memories of Joshua’s vulnerability have yet to fade.', 'Pulev looks lean and confident and Hearn said: “He’s a tough guy. He’s proud. But AJ is in a good place. He’s edgy, he’s nervous, which I think is a great thing because, in these fights behind closed doors, it’s easy to be five rounds in and coast a little. And with 1,000 fans there on Saturday it’s going to be even weirder than having nobody because it’s somewhere in the middle – but still more like an exhibition atmosphere behind closed doors.”', 'The unsettling truth is that this will be the opposite of an exhibition. Robert McCracken, a down-to-earth Brummie realist who has trained Joshua since the amateur days and been in the corner for all his tumultuous high and lows, spoke plainly: “It’s very tough for heavyweight boxers. They are always one punch away from disaster. But Josh’s trained long and hard. He’s taken Pulev deadly serious.”', 'McCracken nodded when asked if he agreed with Hearn’s assessment that Joshua, beneath the amiable quips, is on edge. “He is. Pulev is another top fighter with an unbelievable record – he’s only ever lost to [Wladimir] Klitschko. Very skilled, durable and tough. Josh is up against it because it’s another live challenger. They’re not hand-picked or No 15. It doesn’t work like that with big Josh.”', 'The giant shadow of Fury hangs over the event – even if the 6ft 9in WBC champion with the outrageous suits and outlandish mouth is not expected to accept Hearn’s offer to attend the fight. McCracken was pragmatic again when asked about Fury. “Heavyweight boxing is so dangerous you can’t be thinking of future opponents. You’ve got the mandatory challenger [Pulev] who’s really determined, technically good, physically strong. All Josh thinks about is Pulev. For the last six months really. He’s got to get the job done.”', 'Pulev has a terrific jab – which is so often the key to victory in boxing. But, in the bubble, Pulev revealed even more. He was intelligent and amusing company. “I win all the time,” Pulev said when confirming that he is the Jenga champion in his camp. “It’s very precise, like building, which is my second passion after boxing. I like building, I like designing, I like architecture. From when I was six years old I drew buildings.”', 'Pulev is a proud Bulgarian and he says how much he wants to beat Joshua for the sake of his country and, even more personally, for his late father, Venko. “He was a heavyweight,” Pulev said, “and he loved boxing, like crazy, like a maniac. Before me and my brother were born, he wanted his whole life to have boys who became boxing champions.”', 'Venko Pulev was married three times and he became the father to five girls before, finally, 39 years ago, his son was born. “That was me. He said: ‘Wow! I can’t believe it’. He named me Kubrat which is the name of a very old king in Bulgaria. My middle name is Venko after him. My dad had two passions: boxing and books. He was a maniac about books. We lived in our small apartment and all the walls were completely covered in books, from floor to ceiling. In those socialist days everyone had the same apartment, the same furniture, the same couch. But all our furniture was made especially for books. Ten thousand books in one apartment. Every kind of book. History, romance, boxing.”', 'There was a less literary tone when Pulev spoke of his certainty that, driven by the memories of his father, he would knock out Joshua.', 'The world champion clearly remained the king this week. While he was accommodating, Joshua was tucked away in his own bubble within the larger boxing bubble. He is protected by his management but Joshua understands that he will be alone when Pulev walks towards him in a ring full of jeopardy and uncertainty.', '“I always say Sunday morning will come, so no rush,” Joshua said with a wry smile when I asked him if the last few days of fight week were the hardest. “We’re here now. I’ve trained hard and I feel more confident than last time [the Ruiz rematch]. In Saudi, there was massive pressure. This one I have had a lot of time to work on everything. But it won’t be a walk in the park because, if I don’t take this guy deadly serious, I’m giving him a chance to beat me.”', 'Joshua had heard all the questions about Fury and their anticipated showdown in 2021. “I’ll give you the answers but please, right now, it’s solely about Kubrat Pulev. My focus is not on anyone else.”', 'In a small huddle around Joshua someone persisted and asked how he felt about Fury choosing not to be at ringside. “I don’t think too much about it. He’s a good fighter. He’s done well. Good luck to him, but Saturday night is my night.”', 'Joshua’s cagey display in the Ruiz rematch was followed soon after by Fury crushing Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in Las Vegas in February. “Yeah, but remember it took a long time for Tyson Fury to become destructive,” Joshua said. “I’ve been that destructive ever since I started boxing. But I’m just going to do the job against Pulev in the best way possible. I’m ready for a 12-round fight but if a shot lands and causes a lot of damage I will be looking to take him out. Once a killer always a killer. Certain people can’t sleep at night because they’re really tuned up for a fight but I must be a good psychopath because I’m sleeping like a baby.”', 'Boxing’s capacity for tumult soon replaced such tranquillity. Friday afternoon’s weigh-in descended into a flurry of chaos as Pulev shouted at Joshua: “Tomorrow I’m going to destroy you.” Joshua replied: “What? You? Disrespect me and I’ll show you.”', 'The fighters came nose-to-nose while, at the back of the room, Pulev’s vociferous Bulgarian entourage charged the burly line of security men. The scuffling lasted for 10 seconds before the fighters exchanged more insults.', '“They wouldn’t stop,” Hearn told me afterwards. “In the end Pulev said: ‘I respect you’ and that dampened it. But he started again. Pulev said: ‘Tomorrow I will finish you, I will end you.’ AJ wasn’t rattled. He was calm and cold.”', 'Late on Saturday night, when the bubble darkens, the black lights of the ring will frame the contrasting figures of Joshua and Pulev. All this week’s edgy laughter and noise will die away. Everyone will pause as we wait to see the heavy blows land and discover whether the heavyweight money-spinner between Fury and Joshua has been ruined or secured.', 'Joshua v Pulev is live on Sky Sports Box Office']","Anthony Joshua","Sport","2020-12-11",22.3,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97987ea4c8d49cf9b85c38559970f9984066d49/0_82_4054_2432/master/4054.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a157303a2d38020f78250ee0807a2d99","Tempers flare at the weigh-in before Anthony Joshua’s fight against Kubrat Pulev at Wembley on Saturday night.

He knows there are no guarantees where the big beasts roam, whatever his inclination to dismiss Pulev as a 39-year-old underdog expected to provide stout but unthreatening resistance to the three-belt champion.', 'House fighters, unbeaten heavyweight prospects and ring kings in full flower do lose, sometimes to unlikely opponents, because the showcase division is not a place to make easy assumptions. And that is why the examples often cited to prove that such results are upsets – from James J Braddock beating Max Baer in 1935 to Mike Tyson falling at the feet of Buster Douglas in 1990 – should come with the qualification that a left hook thrown by a selected opponent is as dangerous as one delivered by the favourite. Or a fun-loving Mexican.', 'The Joshua script is written: he beats Pulev, impressively inside the distance – or even in an exciting tear‑up – rings Tyson Fury on Saturday morning, they agree to fight at least twice in 2021 and make more money than anyone in the history of the business, sharing maybe £200m or more. Joshua, in unguarded moments, is looking beyond that scenario.', '“Who’s to say I can’t fight until I’m 38?” he asked rhetorically in a recent interview. “I don’t want to do it because I haven’t paid any bills. I want to do it because I love boxing.”', 'Boxing and Joshua will enjoy a mutual embrace only as long as he delivers for fans persuaded to invest in watching him, and they have done so in unprecedented numbers at four stadium mega-fights, in Cardiff and Wembley. It has been a spectacularly lucrative arrangement for the champion and his associates, so there will be no dissent about the long-term strategy.', 'Pulev – who has been around so long he beat Matt Skelton 10 years ago, when the Bedford man was mysteriously aged, and four years before six-fight novice Joshua ended Skelton’s career – brings gnarled credibility, a chin that has never let him down and the mien of a scarily calm bouncer. But the challenger is not part of the long-term deal. That place at the table is reserved for Fury. Forget Deontay Wilder or any of the other Americans. For now, Joshua is locked into an unsigned pact with his compatriot, one which excites fans every bit as much as when they paid to see Frank Bruno and Lennox Lewis go at it in Cardiff 27 years ago.', 'As the architect of the Joshua phenomenon, Eddie Hearn told the BBC’s Mike Costello: “Every time AJ fights, everybody should cross their fingers.”', 'Pulev is here as an unwelcome guest and, if the IBF’s mandated challenger does what Ruiz did, the sound of jaws hitting the floor will echo around Wembley Arena like a snooker ball rolling off the table at the Crucible.', 'That’s the glory and drama of heavyweight boxing. One punch can derail large chunks of an entire industry. “We go into this fight pretty much knowing the undisputed fight [against the WBC champion Fury] is there if we can get over the final hurdle,” Hearn says.', 'Hearn reckons the ppv take is up 25% since lockdown, because, “You’ve got a captive audience sitting at home on their sofas, looking for things to do. The night in is the new night out.”', 'Joshua insists he is not doing it just for the money. He loves fighting, along with the excitement of fame and a sense of achievement – but of course he’s doing it for the money. Only fools and hardcore amateurs fight for nothing. Joshua is neither.', 'The pressure that counts comes not only from the Bulgarian veteran who will try to prove my ex-boxing friend wrong, but from the expectations of those sitting at ringside and watching at home. Accidentally, perhaps, this is a big fight.', 'There were hints of the storm to come at the weigh-in when emotions spilled over between the camps, and the fighters squared up as ritual demands.', 'As Hearn relates their parting exchange, Pulev called Joshua, “a pussy”, which is a bit yesterday as jibes go, to which the big man, who was banned from the Watford manor he called his own as a wild teenager, replied: “Come over here and say it.”', 'The fight should be better than the buildup.

  ["Anthony Joshua taking Klitschko route to title defence against Pulev","['The world heavyweight champion is still sparring days before Saturday’s fight, a trick he learned from Wladimir Klitschko']","['The hours drag in the last, slow week of a world heavyweight title fight and Anthony Joshua has been sparring at night as a way of killing time while sharpening his final preparations.', 'The IBF, WBA and WBO belt holder faces Kubrat Pulev on Saturday and, usually, a heavyweight champion would have cut back on all forms of sparring by now, but Joshua said: “The body can get soft easy. You’ve got to stay switched on, shots coming at you, gauging distance, feeling different shots. I want someone in the ring imitating Pulev. I want to spar tonight.”', 'Joshua shook his head when asked if being cooped up in a Covid bubble had left him restless and in need of a workout in the ring. “No, we’ve always sparred [in the week of the fight]. We’ll be in a hotel somewhere and we will call one of the local gyms. It’s important to have someone beside you who can push you. It’s good for preparation.', '“I have never had a problem with sparring with anyone getting stuck in. That’s been the best way and what I’ve learned from [the former world champion] Wladimir Klitschko, which is the value of getting all the best talent into one space to challenge me as champion. Four rounds with one, four rounds with another one. I’ve been out for a year and they’ve got me tough. They’ve got me ready.”', 'Eddie Hearn, his promoter, looked briefly alarmed when Joshua casually mentioned he had been in the ring without a headguard on Wednesday night. “We did eight rounds, six with the head guard and two without,” Joshua said. “Rob McCracken [his trainer] didn’t like it. But I know what works for me and Rob manages it. We work together. I could hit the pads, but they don’t hit back. The heavy bag doesn’t move.', '“Having a live opponent in front of you, moving your legs, becomes second nature. The best thing I can do is to do what I need to replicate on Saturday. The ring here [in the hotel] is tiny so I’m going to get into the ring on Saturday and have loads of space to do my job. These things are important.”', 'McCracken has trained Joshua since he was an amateur who went on to win gold at London 2012. He made an important point when asked about Joshua taking his headguard off during sparring. “It’s for the tippy-tappy stuff,” he stressed. “When you do the open sparring the headguard’s got to stay on.”', 'McCracken is too considered a man to allow Joshua to take any unnecessary risks in the ring this close to a title fight and he said: “It’s not sparring as you think, it’s technical, touch stuff. Just to get his coordination and eye in.”', 'Joshua learned some valuable lessons from Klitschko, who defeated Pulev in a world title defence in 2014 – when Joshua also sparred with Klitschko. “It’s crazy how the universe works. I was in a camp with Wladimir and then I fought him [in 2017]. At the time I didn’t really understand the implications of the way Wladimir was training [for Pulev], but I have actually implemented some of the stuff he did in my training for this camp.”', 'Did he learn any specific lessons which will help him beat Pulev? “Definitely. Klitschko was like a heavyweight factory. He invited every heavyweight to his training camp.”', 'Joshua has been an intriguing mix this week of quiet edginess and amiable good cheer. The waiting is almost over and it seems as if his relatively unconventional if gentle sparring in these last nights of preparation has helped him.

  ["Joshua and Fury deserve to split purse of a unification fight, says Hearn","['Promoter says economic reality will dictate venue for bout', 'Joshua defends his world titles against Pulev on Saturday night']","['“I’ve always felt that, commercially, Anthony Joshua is on another planet to Tyson Fury,” Eddie Hearn said while also stressing that Britain’s two world champion heavyweights will agree to a 50-50 split of a huge purse should their planned unification fight happen next year. Hearn promotes Joshua and, during a media conference call, he inevitably set about boosting his fighter’s economic credentials before agreeing that Fury’s achievements in the ring mean that they deserve to share the proceeds.', '“You’ve only got to look at AJ’s endorsement deals and the money he makes,” Hearn said. “The reason that Tyson Fury couldn’t fight in December is that they couldn’t generate the pay-per-view money or the American TV money that AJ can. But Tyson Fury is still a huge star and if you don’t offer him 50/50 then he ain’t going to take it. Do I think he should get 50/50? Commercially, no. But achievement-wise and on recent performances? Yeah, I do.”', 'Joshua defends his IBF, WBA and WBO world titles against Kubrat Pulev at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night. Pulev is a decent fighter, and one of boxing’s proverbial tough nuts, but Joshua is backed so heavily that momentum for a definitive showdown against Fury continues to build. Fury became the WBC champion after his crushing stoppage of Deontay Wilder in February.', '“Our job over the next couple of weeks is to get that [unification] fight in place,” Hearn said. “If AJ beats Pulev, we want to go to the governing bodies and say: ‘Deal agreed, contracts signed and this is the proposed date. Will you sanction it as an undisputed fight?’”', 'Hearn was unequivocal that calls for the fight to be held in London need to be balanced by hard-nosed economic realities. After Joshua spoke last week about his possible willingness to accept a reduced purse to fight Fury in Britain, Hearn said: “I’m more brutally honest. We’ll discuss with both management teams the opportunities that are out there in terms of site fees and money in the pot. AJ has consistently earned a lot of money and will he care less about the number in the pot than Fury? Probably. But he’s not going to do it for half the money because it sounds nice. His team is going to make the right decision for his career.”', 'The promoter suggested that “everybody” in the two camps “would prefer the fight to take place in London”.', 'He added: “ But we have to rely on revenue generated via the gate and not the revenue generated by a tourism board or by a government to bring an event like that to another country. It will probably be a 50% pay cut to do the fight in the UK and that’s how brutal it is.”', 'Hearn suggested the ideal time to stage the fight would be “the end of May”. But it is unclear whether the vaccine against Covid-19 will have been introduced successfully in the UK by then while, in the Middle East, which remains the probable location, Hearn pointed out that “you have Ramadan from April to early May.”', 'He was asked what he would do if, in an unlikely scenario, both boxers insisted that they fight in the UK. “We do it in a heartbeat. But it’s not how it works in sport and especially not in the fight game. And it shouldn’t. Everyone says Daniel Dubois quit, that he’s got no heart [after the young British heavyweight suffered a serious eye injury and chose not to continue against Joe Joyce last month]. The other argument is: ‘Actually, he could have lost his eyesight in there.’ You’re basically saying the fighter should put his health on the line without getting the maximum reward financially for that risk. If it’s close, if it’s marginal, all day long do it in the UK. But half the money shouldn’t even be considered.”', 'Hearn believes a Fury-Joshua bout would generate sufficient interest to result in a rematch. “One of those fights, in my opinion, must take place in the UK,” he said. “But, particularly the first fight, both teams will say to me: ‘Show us how this fight works, show us the finances.’ I’ll present every option to them.”', 'Before then Joshua needs to beat Pulev in front of British boxing’s first crowd of the pandemic. One thousand fans will be allowed into the arena and Hearn said he is “excited but nervous” about both the event and Saturday’s headline fight. “If anything goes wrong it affects boxing moving forward. Listen, I’m nervous about the fight. We have never seen AJ box in an environment like this – but I actually think it could suit him.

Speaking for myself, Anthony and his management team, I know how hard we’ve worked these last couple of months. I just feel that this fight is so big it’s not a difficult sell. We’ve already had approaches from eight or nine sites in the Middle East, Asia, eastern Europe and America.”', 'Hearn added: “We’d like to get a site deal confirmed in the next month. The hard part is always getting everybody to put pen to paper. But this was a major effort from all parties to get this over the line.”', 'Confirmation of a signed contract is a welcome step forward amid tortuous negotiations, but the fight is still some distance from being finalised. Hearn conceded to British reporters last week that Fury and Joshua could still walk away from their signed contracts if they are dissatisfied with the venue and size of their purse, which they will split on a 50-50 basis for the first fight.', '“This is the biggest fight in boxing and one of the biggest sporting events in the world,” Hearn said. “It will be a major, major win for a country that wants to showcase itself.”', 'Saudi Arabia is expected to offer the kind of outrageous money needed to secure the fight as staging a sporting contest of this magnitude fits the idea that the country’s poor record on human rights can be smoothed by “sportswashing” – where staging a global event presents a more positive image to the world.', 'Last week Hearn told the British fight press that a counter offer might emerge from Las Vegas but, with no guarantee on the size of a crowd owing to the pandemic, it is hard to see how even the giant US casinos can match a bid from the Middle East. Hearn also admitted the only way the fight could be held in Britain was if a crowd of 100,000 could attend – “and that seems impossible”.', 'Hearn’s announcement of the contract being signed comes just four days after Fury claimed that, as the fight against Joshua was “nowhere near” to being finalised, he had stopped training and was drinking heavily.', '“Until I’ve got a date and a load of money in my pocket, there’s no fight,” Fury said in a bizarre video. “A lot of things behind the scenes can scupper a fight like that. We’re nowhere near at the moment. I’ve stopped training now, I’m on holiday. I’m doing anything between 10 to 12 pints of lager a day.”', 'Those close to Fury’s camp offer a very different view. They insist he is in training while last week Hearn said: “I don’t know whether Tyson was in a bad mood or pulling everyone’s plonker. What I do know is everyone has put a lot of work into this deal and he is on board.”', 'The fact that Fury and Joshua have at least signed the contract supports Hearn’s claim.

Fury then responded by calling his rival a “big ugly dosser” and suggesting he was “no talk, no action”.', 'Hearn was more upbeat, however, saying a contract for the fight was close, even though Fury is yet to agree terms. “From our perspective and AJ’s perspective, we’re ready to go,” he said. “From Tyson Fury’s perspective, they’ve got a couple of lawyers across it from their point.', '“There’s no reason why it shouldn’t happen this week. We’re not far away from their side and it is inevitable, but at the same time we’ve got to close the door on it.”', 'After confirming the fight would be staged in Saudi Arabia, Hearn said his preference was for it to take place on 14 August. “You’ve got the Olympics finishing on 7 August, so in terms of a global spectacle it would make sense to go on the 14th.

Stenson has not had any notion to strike a ball since.', '“I don’t feel the rush to practise and play,” the Swede says. “Five weeks out is when I’ll start digging in hard because I’ll have something on the horizon. I want to be ready and prepared when we get the go-ahead because this is going to impact so many things in this sport.”', 'But out from when? The Masters is postponed, as is the US PGA Championship. The staging of the US Open in June remains a long-shot and the Open a month later is shrouded in doubt.', '“Once we started the Players I expected us to finish but everything happened so quickly,” Stenson says. “You only need one person to be sick at a tournament and you have all sorts of implications. I have no issues at all with the decision.', '“If I am going to find some small positive, I have to go back to 2003-2004 for the last time I had a nine-10 week off season. This one is obviously not intended but I have to try to use the time as best I can. I’ll focus on workouts and doing some fun stuff you don’t get to do otherwise; cleaning the garage, cleaning closets. There’s always things to do and things to accomplish, right?”', 'Stenson cherished golf’s return to the Olympic scene as he collected silver in Rio. If postponement of the Tokyo Games was inevitable, it still stung the 43-year-old.', '“Both as an experience but also as my last chance to get another or a better medal,” he says. “The Olympics and Ryder Cup were highlights looking at 2020.”', 'At least the Olympic scenario is relatively clear cut. “I have played two full tournaments in the PGA Tour season so what about the FedEx Cup and qualifying for the play-offs?” Stenson asks. “Some guys have played 15 events. How do you tackle all that if you start playing in June or July? I am exempt through next year on the PGA Tour, so it doesn’t really matter for playing privileges, but for some guys that’s a big thing.”', 'Could the Ryder Cup become the sole domain of picks? “No matter what you do there, it’s going to be unfair to some. Tyrrell Hatton who won in Turkey and won at Bay Hill. Can you go to picks and – this is hypothetical, clearly – a captain feels he doesn’t fit into the 12? Someone could go from a lock to not in the team.”', 'Stenson is a former Open champion, a past recipient of the FedEx Cup’s $10m bonus and a Ryder Cup stalwart. It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson’s case, completely unfair. He acknowledges the gravity of this pandemic.', '“There’s a lot of fun stuff available for the kids and for us here [at the family home in Florida] but I’m not sure I should mention that when you have someone locked in an apartment and can’t go outside,” Stenson says. “It’s disastrous on a global level from people being really sick to losing their lives, to the world economy plummeting. Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs.', '“They say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I’ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae’s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won’t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger. This is nasty.”', 'Stenson’s coach, Pete Cowen, tested positive after returning from the Players. “He picked it up on his travels, from what I understand,” Stenson says. “I hope and believe he wasn’t contagious when I last saw him. I think he will get through it but he has been feeling pretty bad.”', 'That Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm have dismissed the breakaway Premier Golf League spells the end to some but Stenson suggests tales of PGL’s demise are premature.', '“They are still here, trying to make what they believe is the best product for golf,” he says. “For as long as I can remember, people complain the fields aren’t strong enough. You can’t have the top 30 guys on each tour playing 44 times in a year, it just isn’t doable.', '“There are a number of things I like about this concept, one is the best players competing against each other on a much more regular basis. I also think golf would really benefit from a proper off-season, without feeling when you have your own time off that you are missing out because others are playing.', '“Whether we end up there in the short-term or long-term I couldn’t tell you but I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up there at one point.”']","Henrik Stenson","Sport","2020-03-29",19,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6150d70f6a30d72fbe326c5a0f9ca2a0de87f338/0_153_4564_2738/master/4564.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=06a8bed164f2e12bc9c998aff1dd3b61","Henrik Stenson last played at the Players Championship, which was abandoned after the first round, on 12 March.

  ["Autumn Masters in Augusta’s sights after coronavirus forces postponement","['Augusta hope to stage tournament in September or October']","['Augusta National hopes it can break with tradition and host the Masters in autumn, after the first major of the year became another high-profile sporting victim of the coronavirus outbreak.', 'Fred Ridley, Augusta’s chairman, announced on Friday that the Masters had been postponed and expressed a wish to hold the tournament over new dates. That Tiger Woods is due to defend his title renders the next, and 84th, Masters highly significant.', 'Augusta came under pressure after the PGA Tour cancelled its marquee event, the Players Championship, with just one round played. The Valspar Championship, World Golf Championship Match Play and Texas Open were also removed from the schedule. There were tentative noises that the Masters, which had been set to start on 9 April, could be played without spectators but the outcome was instead firmer.', '“Unfortunately, the ever-increasing risks associated with the widespread coronavirus Covid-19 have led us to a decision that undoubtedly will be disappointing to many, although I am confident is appropriate under these unique circumstances,” said Ridley. “Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals.', '“Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision. We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date.”', 'The Masters has been staged in April in all but two years. In 1934 – at the inaugural tournament – and 1939 it was played in March. There was no Masters between 1943 and 1945, with the course hosting cattle to assist with the US war effort.', 'September or October have initially been mooted as potential slots for 2020 but the crowded golf calendar, including a Ryder Cup this year, render any such switch highly complicated. The summer climate in Georgia rules that period out. As things stand the other three majors – the US PGA Championship, US Open and Open Championship – are scheduled to go ahead as planned but there is obvious and considerable doubt attached to them.', '“I’m not surprised, not surprised at all,” said Paul Casey, the world No 24 of Augusta’s actions. “This is now a pandemic. The ladies and gentlemen that run that great event have very smart minds and are taking the right precautions. I think we as a collective in the golf community felt that we were taking the necessary precautions and it was important to continue. But obviously it got to a tipping point and we realised that that’s not the right thing to be doing.”', 'Justin Thomas, a former US PGA winner, added: “I felt like there was no chance we were going to play the Masters. It’s so soon.”', 'The Tour’s decision to suspend standard events was also widely welcomed by players. Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour’s commissioner, initially announced a plan to complete the closing 54 holes of the Players Championship and three subsequent tournaments behind closed doors. The model swiftly changed to total lockdown.', '“Of course it’s the right decision,” said the world No 1, Rory McIlroy. “If in a few weeks’ time this dies down and everything is OK, it’s still the right decision.', '“I’ve got no golf to play coming up. I was supposed to have my coach, Michael Bannon, fly out next week and we were going to spend some time together, and that’s probably not going to happen, him coming from Ireland. I’ll probably just spend some time at home, evaluate the situation, and see where we go.”', 'As Monahan addressed the media on Friday morning, the toll this scenario had taken on him was visible. “Ultimately there were some players that were concerned [about continuing with the Players],” Monahan said. “That’s something that we took into consideration and took very seriously.', '“As we step back and we think about when we’re going to play, we need to do all the things that led us to this decision. We need to continue to understand what’s happening on the ground in the markets where we would be returning to play, continue to work with our partners in those markets, continue to understand what’s happening with the CDC and the World Health Organisation, and then ultimately that will guide our decision. We’re going to make sure that we protect the safety and wellbeing of all of our constituents as we make that decision.”', 'Monahan confirmed 50% of the Players prize fund, $7.5m, will be paid out equally to competitors. Eighteen holes at Sawgrass on Thursday, therefore, earned these individuals around $52,000 each.']","The Masters","Sport","2020-03-13",20.25,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b85ea7c9494e643a517bf4a8ffd7a42974f6d8/0_354_5289_3173/master/5289.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8c2f20bfb03994f5aeb4befd244b2762","The Masters has been postponed.

  ["Hideki Matsuyama is Japanese but his victory matters for Asian Americans","['The Masters champion appears to have little in common with Asian Americans. But his win comes at a time when any Asian success story is welcome in the US']","['And with that, Hideki Matsuyama is the first male Japanese player ever to win a golf major.', 'Quite interesting timing, particularly as anti-Asian hate crimes in the US have risen 150% over the past year, spurred on by conspiracy theories – spread by those in power – about the origins of Covid-19. The hashtag ‘Stop Asian Hate’ surged more than 5,000% just this past month, according to Google Trends.', 'What does Matsuyama’s win have to do with America? At first, I contemplated this and thought: “nothing”. He is from Japan, with absolutely no ties to North America – outside of his Oakley sponsor. Many Asian Americans may feel more of a kinship with Tiger Woods than with Matsuyama, but then again, almost five other racial identities do as well.', 'Parallels can be drawn to when Yao Ming first arrived in 2002, or when Jeremy Lin rose to prominence during Linsanity in 2012. During Yao’s time in the NBA, most Asian Americans saw no commonality with a 7ft 6in giant from a country that might as well have been from another solar system culturally. I, for one, cheered on Shaquille O’Neal when Yao was matched up against him. Like many other Asian Americans, I felt more in touch with an underdog who had a somewhat similar origin of growing up in California than someone who was essentially groomed as a young child to become China’s national marvel. (Speaking to how out of touch America was just two decades ago, don’t forget that the Heat somehow thought it was a great PR move to pass out 8,000 fortune cookies to fans during Yao’s first game in Miami. Fortune cookies do not originate from China, and actually came from 19th century Japan.)', 'Some of us do ponder if Matsuyama’s win may actually encourage more animosity against Asians, specifically in the US. Much of golf’s American audience is white and conservative, from areas where there are few Asians. For some of them, seeing someone other than a white man in a green jacket may cause resentment – after all, it’s not like everyone was happy when Woods started his era of dominance among the country club set.', 'But we should put those worries aside. The first generation of Asian Americans came to this country to give a better life for the following generations. In order for all Americans to live in a country of compassion and acceptance, we must push forwards more minority-driven narratives. At the end of the day, it really does not matter if Matsuyama was raised American or western culturally. What really matters is seeing people of color doing great things. We need to get to the point where it is natural to see lead characters in films, or dominant athletes, coming from all backgrounds.', 'Over the course of the year, news outlets have started to turn more attention to hate crimes and racism against Asians. Many cable news channels have started to bring in Asian influencers and activists to continue the conversation. No doubt, this would have just been part of the news cycle, and the shows would soon have moved on to other ‘newsworthy’ subject matter.', 'Instead, came the domestic terrorism shootings in Georgia – the same state, incidentally, where Matsuyama won the Masters – which thrust the topic into the national spotlight, and a domino effect started.', 'The model minority stereotype has been thrust aside, at least momentarily, as Asian Americans from all walks of life have fought back publicly against racism. An Ohio politician named Lee Wong, sick of people questioning whether he is American, removed his shirt during a town meeting and showed a deep scar that he suffered while serving in the US Army and asked: “Is this patriot enough?” A 75-year-old Chinese woman, who was attacked in San Francisco and bravely fought off her assailant, donated all of the funds raised for her – just under $1m – back into the Asian-American community to fight racism.', 'As sad as it sounds, one has to wonder had this pandemic and the Georgia shootings not occurred, would the Asian American community continue to be ignored? What outsiders always seem to forget is that Asian Americans differ drastically in cultural terms – we are Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Burmese, Vietnamese … the list goes on. Yet the one thing that holds us all together is the same meaningless taunt of “Go back to China!” or “You don’t belong here”. The only thing we as a community can do collectively is continue to celebrate Asian success stories like Matsuyama’s, no matter how rarely they come – and even if they’re from someone we seem to have little in common with.

  ["Hideki Matsuyama holds nerve to become Masters champion","['Final round of 73 enough to secure Green Jacket', 'Matsuyama becomes first Japanese male major winner']","['One can only assume Hideki Matsuyama did not feel the heavy burden of history at all. There is no other reasonable explanation for the manner in which the 29-year-old won the 85th edition of the Masters. Matsuyama has become the first Asian-born player to don a Green Jacket and the only Japanese male to win a major.', 'His is a victory that will reverberate far beyond this exclusive corner of Georgia. Positive impacts for golf as a whole, it can only be hoped, will follow. A nation that has long since developed an affinity with this sport belatedly has its idol. The Green Jackets, who regard themselves as progressives these days, will be giddy with excitement at the expansion of their roll of honour into fresh territory. A global game needs global stars, after all.', 'Matsuyama’s 10 under par secured the first major of 2021 by one shot from Will Zalatoris. Jordan Spieth closed in a share of third with Xander Schauffele at minus seven.', 'It was just a pity that a vast Japanese media contingent, who ordinarily would track Matsuyama’s every move, were not on site. Covid has denied them first-hand accounts of the moments they have pursued for so long and would have treasured. A cruel sporting fate.', 'Brief worry for the champion arrived with a bogey at the 1st. As Zalatoris collected a shot up ahead at the 2nd – the debutant had also hit birdie on the opening hole – Matsuyama’s lead was just a shot.', 'The response set the tone for the rest of Matsuyama’s day. He comfortably shot birdie on the par-five 2nd and did likewise on the final two holes of the front nine. Matsuyama marched down the 10th with a five-shot lead. Not even the perils associated with Amen Corner could deny him from here, surely.', 'Matsuyama did make a bogey after playing his tee shot at the 12th into a bunker. The damage was immediately repaired with a birdie at the 13th. All the while, no one from the chasing pack was making sufficient inroads for the champion-elect to fret. The key period of this Masters actually arrived after a 75-minute weather delay on Saturday, with Matsuyama emerging to play his back nine in six under par. This afforded a level of leeway and comfort the world No 25 could lean on during the final day. Whisper it, but large chunks of the denouement were anti-climactic.', 'The finding of water at the 15th drew a groan but little more, given Matsuyama was four ahead of Schauffele, his playing partner. Schauffele almost holed out from the greenside bunker for an eagle but Matsuyama was able to ensure 12 under played 10 under.', 'Schauffele was now the key threat; he had now had four birdies in a row. Disaster followed for the world No 6, who found water from the tee at the par-three 16th and fired his third shot over the green. Matsuyama could exhale. A bogey for the Japanese was fine in context of Schauffele’s six.', 'Zalatoris is due immense credit for his display. Not since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 has a player won the Masters first time out. Zalatoris didn’t manage that but the strength he displayed to stay so prominent points towards brighter days. A Sunday 70 confirmed the best finish of his professional career and rendered him the first Masters rookie to be runner-up since 1982. Zalatoris was born in 1996.', 'Spieth will contemplate what might have been. His bogey at the 1st denied the opportunity for the momentum desperately needed. Still, and typically, the resurgent Texan fought on; from a tournament aggregate of three under after eight he finished four shots better. Another major title, you feel, is not far away.', 'Justin Rose, who appeared to be battling technical issues all weekend, slipped to a closing 74 for seventh place. Patrick Reed and Corey Conners closed one shy of Rose’s total. Robert MacIntyre’s 72 and level-par aggregate was enough to secure him top-12 finish and, therefore, an invitation back to Augusta in 2022. Fine work for the Scottish debutant.', 'Jon Rahm’s 66 earned him tied fifth with Marc Leishman. “Each day I played better golf,” Rahm said. “First three days I just couldn’t get anything going. Today was the complete opposite. Started the way I started and that set the tone for the rest of the round.', '“I’m happy. It’s still a top five at a major with a great round on a Sunday. I think that’s 15 straight rounds of even par or better here. Clearly I like the place, I play good here. My year is coming up. Let’s hope it’s soon.”', 'Rahm had left the premises long before Matsuyama took on the kind of scenario of which golfers dream. On the 72nd hole of the tournament he first played in as an amateur a decade ago, all Matsuyama had to do was place one foot in front of the other. A bogey mattered not.', '“He’s just a great player,” said Charl Schwartzel, who won that 2011 Masters. “He has shown us all over the last 10 years that, when he gets going, he’s a guy that feeds off confidence. He sets high expectations. But as you saw yesterday after the rain delay, that’s how Hideki plays when he’s got confidence, straight at every flag, and he seems to pull them off too.” In the time-honoured words of Alphaville; big in Japan, all right.']","The Masters","Sport","2021-04-12",0.13,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e066da32b169fe0830d43e4ad2937c105f4d92/0_21_2955_1773/master/2955.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=85be76dc7e50dda5ec8acb4a10745f19","Hideki Matsuyama celebrates in the Green Jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta.

Although destined for a missed cut anyway, Matthew Wolff was disqualified on Friday evening having signed for a lower score than he had delivered at the 17th hole of his second round.', '“Obviously I wanted to be around for the weekend,” Johnson said. “I like this golf course. I feel like I play it very well. I just didn’t putt very good. It’s pretty simple. Six three-putts in two rounds, you just can’t do that,” he continued. “Obviously I didn’t drive it great but drove it good enough, and I felt like I never was really too bad out of position, just the three-putts killed me. You take all the three-putts away, I’m one under. That was kind of the difference. I just didn’t putt very well.”', 'Koepka’s scenario can be readily explained by the undergoing of knee surgery just last month. Not that the four-times major winner was placated by extenuating circumstance. “How disappointed do you think I am?” Koepka asked. “I worked my ass off just to get here and then to play like this is pretty disappointing.”', 'Koepka, who matched Johnson’s score, suggested he may not play competitively again before the next major of the year. The US PGA Championship takes place at Kiawah Island in late May.', '“I wouldn’t have been playing for another month if it wasn’t this week,” he added. “So I’ll take a nice long break after this. Way I look at it, I have two more days to do rehab that I probably wouldn’t get if I was out here, and I’ll get ready for the PGA.”', 'García missed the cut by one, largely due to a Thursday 76; the 2017 champion signed for 72 in the second round. “I think I played great,” he said. “It’s just hard to know what to say. I felt like the way I played today, I should have never shot more than two or three under par. That should have been my worst score, and somehow, I don’t know why, it just wouldn’t happen. I couldn’t shoot one more shot than I shot today, the way I played.”', 'McIlroy, who hadn’t missed an Augusta cut since his second Masters appearance of 2010, did not appear for post-round media duties.

By close of play, Jordan Spieth had appeared in Rose’s rearview mirror like the kind of old friend you smile at while wishing they were somewhere else entirely.', 'In 2015, Rose tried to chase down Spieth on a Masters Sunday and failed. While the scenario is, for now, entirely different – Rose holds the advantage and there are 36 holes to play – Spieth is striding forward as golf’s redemption man. That he is within touching distance of Rose’s lead, days after a first tournament victory in almost four years, feels hugely significant.', 'Does Spieth allow himself to believe he can win? Too right, he does. “I came in thinking that,” he said. “I’m in position now to think that, for sure. At the halfway point, I would have been pleased with being two back.', '“I’m happy that the golf course has the opportunity to play more and more difficult over the weekend. I’m looking forward to that kind of challenge and I think that could be an advantage to me if I’m in control of the ball.” Spieth seemed perfectly aware that gusting winds are in Saturday afternoon’s forecast.', 'It is hardly being cruel to Rose to point out the will of most neutral observers will be for Spieth to claim a second Masters come Sunday evening in this iconic corner of Georgia. Yet such outcomes still feel a long way off. Rose, at seven under par, leads by one from Will Zalatoris and Brian Harman. Spieth has joined Marc Leishman at minus five.', 'Rory McIlroy was among those to miss the Augusta cut, the first time the Northern Irishman has suffered such ignominy here since 2010. Brooks Koepka also exited stage left after providing unwanted reference to The Best of the Connells (on the basis such a thing exists): 74-75.', 'That Rose shot level par belies the full story of his day. Having started the second round with a four-shot lead, the Englishman handed three strokes back to the course by the 8th tee. At the 6th, a 67ft Rose putt lacked sufficient gusto to negotiate a hill and rolled back to his feet. He remained at minus four, and by this point tied with Bernd Wiesberger, until a birdie at the 13th. Rose picked up further shots at the 14th and 16th in hauling himself back to the aggregate position he had teed off at. A 72, of course, lacked the fireworks of his first-round 65 but Rose, such a fierce competitor, stood firm when it would have been easy to wilt.', '“I think it was just a classic day at Augusta National when you’re just slightly off,” Rose explained. “You can be a foot or two out on certain occasions and you end up struggling. I think maybe off the back of yesterday, it starts to feel pretty different pretty quickly.', '“I had a word with myself on the 8th tee. I just changed my mindset a little bit at that point and started to play match play against the golf course. I scratched a line on my scorecard and told myself I was three down, could I go ahead and beat the golf course from that point on? I had a putt on 18 to win my match 1up, but unfortunately it just slipped by. An honourable draw.” As Rose knows only too well, the Masters demands a victor.', 'Spieth dropped just a single shot during his 68. Birdies at the 2nd, 10th, 13th, 15th and 17th endorsed his new-found confidence. Leishman posted 67 from the morning wave. Zalatoris’s 68 and Harman’s 69 were delivered late in the day.', 'Justin Thomas, whose claims on this event looked stronger than anybody’s before a ball was struck, sat alongside Spieth at five under until a mishap at the last. Thomas lipped out for par from 7ft, turning a 66 into a 67. Thomas has Tony Finau, Kim Si-woo, Cameron Champ, Hideki Matsuyama and Wiesberger for company at minus four.', 'Bryson DeChambeau showed he has grit to match his eccentricity with a 67 – nine strokes better than he managed on Thursday. At one under par, it would be foolish to rule out Masters glory for the reigning US Open champion. From the course he headed to the range, battering drive after drive until darkness drew near. His is a relentless pursuit.', '“You have to experience failure in order to understand what success is,” DeChambeau said. “It’s just not realistic to have success all the time. That’s what’s so great about this golf course.”', 'That José María Olazábal survived the cut was stunning. The Spaniard, who won here in 1994 and 1999, hadn’t played competitive golf since struggling at the last Masters in November. There, he signed for 78 and 80. The 55-year-old returned to add a 71 to Thursday’s 75, thereby squeezing into the final 36 holes for the first time since 2014.', '“It’s like winning the event,” said a beaming Olazabal. “I enjoyed the two days. Obviously, because I hit the ball better but because of the conditions on the golf course. It’s lovely to see Augusta played like we have the last two days, fast and firm. It reminds me a lot of the late ‘80s and ‘90s.” On what would have been Seve Ballesteros’s 64th birthday, there was poignancy attached to that comment.']","The Masters","Sport","2021-04-10",0.12,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f632904a795ba2017e9bb52d379eeb8e235f30d8/41_186_3917_2352/master/3917.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e3830acd1cf5d70cfb7d048d57c8350c","Justin Rose is happy after putting on the 18th for a 72 to add to his opening 65, to hold a one-shot lead at the halfway point of the Masters.

  ["Paul Casey and Tiger Woods among old guard leading the way at the Masters","['Casey is clubhouse leader on 65, Woods and Westwood post 68', 'Three-hour rain delay meant full round was not completed']","['Father Time was perhaps riled by the domination of pre-Masters discussion of what athleticism and equipment – or, to be precise, Bryson DeChambeau – may do to Augusta National. Sixteen years have passed since Paul Casey tied sixth on his Masters debut. Tiger Woods first competed at Augusta National two and a half decades ago. As DeChambeau battled swing demons – not entirely unsuccessfully, it must be said – Casey strode to the top of the leaderboard, with Woods in close pursuit.', 'Casey’s 65 included five birdies and an eagle. It represented a 16-stroke improvement from his first Masters round of 2019. In truth, the latter performance is an anomaly in context of his strong Augusta record. A more pertinent reference point appears the Englishman’s second place in this summer’s US PGA Championship; but Georgia was always on his mind.', '“This is something I’ve looked forward to,” Casey explained. “I was vocal earlier in the year about not enjoying golf in a pandemic. I’m acutely aware that I’m in a very fortunate position. I still get to be a professional golfer and play championship golf, but I didn’t know how the fan-less experience would be. So far, I’ve not enjoyed it and I felt the lack of energy. I’ve had nothing or very little to draw from, being out playing tournament golf.', '“The Masters, though … this week, it still has a buzz to it. There’s an energy and a little bit of a vibe. Yes, it’s clearly a lot less than what we are used to but there’s something about this place. I felt excited to be here. I’ve never been so happy to pass a Covid test, just to get in.', '“With the history of this championship, this tournament. So many people like myself are just excited to play this. This is a treat. It always has been and always will be a real treat.”', 'At 43, Casey is seeking the maiden major win that would haul his career into fresh territory. At 44, Woods is now in hot pursuit of a sixth Green Jacket. The defending champion’s chances heading into this event were seen as remote; how Woods silenced the naysayers with a wonderfully composed 68. Incredibly, this marked just his second sub-70 opening Masters round.', 'By Woods’s own calm assessment: “I did everything well.” There was, though, time to reflect on the value of Augusta experience. “I think that understanding how to play this golf course is so important,” he added. “I’ve been lucky enough to have so many practice rounds throughout my career with so many past champions, and I was able to win this event early in my career and build myself up for the understanding that I’m going to come here each and every year.', '“So understanding of how to play it is a big factor and it’s one of the reasons why early in my career that I saw Jack [Nicklaus] contending a lot, I saw Raymond [Floyd] contending late in his career, now Bernhard Langer and Freddie Couples always contend here late in their careers. Just understanding how to play this golf course is a big part of it.”', 'DeChambeau’s first four holes included two provisional balls, pine straw, Rae’s Creek, a bush, a penalty drop and a fluffed chip. He was two over par taking to the 14th, his fifth, tee. The ghosts of MacKenzie and Jones looked to be in play. To his credit – and in emphasising his level of talent – the Californian rallied to the point where he signed for a 70. “I am fortunate to be two under par,” he admitted. He spent most of the day fighting a hook which will need to be eliminated if he is to contend for the Green Jacket.', 'Casey’s lead is two, from Xander Schauffele and Webb Simpson. Justin Thomas, who has played only 10 holes, is also five under. Lee Westwood, Hideki Matsuyama, Louis Oosthuizen and Patrick Reed matched Woods’s 68.', 'A three-hour delay, caused by a forecast thunderstorm that duly hit Augusta in the morning, meant a host of players must return to complete their first rounds on Friday. Rory McIlroy is level at the turn with Dustin Johnson, one of the Northern Irishman’s playing partners, on three under. Thomas birdied his first three holes in serving notice that he was rightly among the Masters favourites; he collected a shot at the hazardous 10th immediately before the horn blew.', 'Nicklaus and Gary Player had undertaken ceremonial starting duties shortly before the delay. Nicklaus created something of a storm before the US presidential election when offering strong support for Donald Trump. Naturally, the 18-times major winner was asked if he now had any follow-up comments. Naturally his reply was curt. “I think I’ve said enough about that. I don’t think this is the place for politics.”', 'Nicklaus did, though, share an endearing tale relating to his time in the Crow’s Nest, Augusta’s standard lodgings for amateur players, during the 1959 Masters. “We had Phil Rodgers, Deane Beman, Ward Wettlaufer, Tommy Aaron and myself,” Nicklaus recalled. “We all stayed there. That’s not a very big place, if you happen to go look at it, for five guys. One bathroom, one shower. But we all stayed there, and of course Phil and I were the big eaters at the time.', '“The amateurs had to be charged for their food, so they charged us a dollar for breakfast, a dollar for lunch and two dollars for dinner. Phil and I, generally speaking, would have two steaks at night. They came to us after a couple nights and they said: ‘Gentlemen, you’re abusing the thing with eating two steaks, we’re going to have to charge you $2 apiece.’ I said: ‘That’ll be quite all right.’” Simpler times.']","The Masters","Sport","2020-11-13",0.1,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66cdadaa997e18dba85fdb64efe6f4b9fe8a5282/70_176_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7df59268f1cd0344e0989ff6969c52ba","Paul Casey works on his grip while Patrick Reed’s caddie, Kessler Karain, lines up a putt for his man on the 5th green.

The Scuderia endured their worst result of the season at Spa-Francorchamps, with Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel both finishing outside the points. However, Binotto has denied that the team are in crisis.', 'Their slump in performance has been directly attributed to a reduction in engine power after questions over its legality last season led to an investigation and subsequent rule clarification from the FIA. Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, said in Spa that the process had left a “sour taste” and had potentially denied his team victories in 2019.', 'Lewis Hamilton won at Spa with a dominant, trouble-free run from pole to flag. His teammate Valtteri Bottas finished second, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen third. Ferrari, who have won the previous two meetings in Belgium, were well off the pace all weekend. Leclerc and Vettel qualified in 13th and 14th and finished in 14th and 13th respectively. They spent just five of the 44 laps with a car inside the top 10. ', 'Clearly down on power, the Ferraris could not compete on the straights and Leclerc said it was difficult to make a pass even with DRS. Vettel was overtaken by Kimi Räikkönen in a Ferrari customer-engined Alfa Romeo and who finished in 12th.', '“We are disappointed and angry, as indeed are our fans and with good reason,” said Binotto. “It’s a difficult moment in a season that we knew from the start would be a tough one, but it’s at times like this that we need to stand firm and look ahead in order to get over this difficult period. It’s the only way we will get out of this situation.”', 'Ferrari have struggled for power since the FIA investigated their engine and instituted rules relating to the fuel flow toward the end of last year. Ferrari were not penalised, however, and the FIA did not release their findings, instead coming to a controversial private settlement with the team.', 'On the power-dependent straights of Spa the shortcomings of the new engine were writ large. Their car is also draggy and the team struggled with switching their tyres on at the circuit, compounding their lack of pace.', 'At the previous two meetings Ferrari completely dominated in Belgium and other teams have interpreted the fall-off in performance as indicative of just how large an advantage their previous engine configuration was giving them last year.', '“The whole thing has left quite a sour taste,” said Horner. “Obviously, you can draw your own conclusions from Ferrari’s current performance. There are races we should have won last year arguably if they had run with an engine that seems to be quite different to last year.”', 'Red Bull were third, 87 points behind Ferrari in the 2019 constructors’ championship.', 'Ferrari face a further turbulent two weeks. They go into a double header of home races starting next weekend at Monza, immediately followed by the first F1 race at the circuit owned by the team at Mugello, which will also be the first race this season to host a limited number of fans.', 'Binotto insisted his team were handling the pressure calmly. “It is wrong to use the word ‘crisis’ for the moment we are going through,” he said. “We all take responsibility for this situation.

I lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end. All my form went out of the window. I ran like an amateur, I cannot believe it, I came so close, this was such a good chance. My body feels good, I ran well through the heats. I let it go.”', 'His time of 20.03sec was a season’s best. But it was painfully short of the American Noah Lyles, who celebrated his first world title after coming home in a modest 19.83 sec. Short of the Canadian Andre De Grasse, who took silver in 19.95. And short of the Ecuadorian Alex Quinonez, who came home in 19.98.', '“I am sorry, I feel like I have let down so many people,” admitted Gemili. “So many people sent me messages. The team know I have been plagued with injuries.”', 'Gemili has had this feeling before. At the 2016 Rio Olympics he finished fourth in the 200m final, three thousands of a second away from bronze.', '“It’s the same, if not worse than that feeling after Rio because of the story behind it, where I’ve come from after injuries and being written off completely.', '“To not break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. Fourth is the same as eighth, the same as 16th. Unless you’re on the podium, who cares?”', 'Still, at least Gemili ended on an upbeat note. “It hasn’t happened today, but it has relit something inside me,” he said. “If I go to Tokyo it’s winnable.”', 'It means that Britain still only has one medal after five days of competition. However Dina Asher-Smith is a penalty kick away from gold in the 200m after yet another potential rival, Elaine Thompson, was ruled out through injury. It means that only four of the top 10 in the world will be in Wednesday’s final – with Asher-Smith fastest of all.', '“Dina is going to win,” predicted Gemili. “This is the best opportunity for a female sprinter to win a medal. She’s miles apart from everyone. It’s not about if she’s going to win it, it’s about how fast she can go. I’m hoping she can do something really special.”', 'Elsewhere there was an easy victory in the 800m for the Nike Oregon Project athlete Donavan Brazier in a US record 1:42.34, ahead of the Bosnian Amel Tuka and the Kenyan Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich.', 'When Brazier was asked what he knew about Alberto Salazar’s doping ban, he surprised his audience by telling them: “I didn’t actually know the investigation was going on. And he’s not my coach - I’m coached by Pete Julian.”', 'When some put it to him that what had happened might have changed his opinion of Salazar he shook his head. “No. The only contact I’ve had with Alberto has been pleasant. I like Alberto. He’s a cool guy.”', 'And when asked if he would stay with the Oregon Project, he added: “Yeah, if Pete takes control.”', 'Meanwhile a thrilling men’s pole vault competition was won by the American Sam Kendricks, who cleared 5.97m to defeat the Swedish teen sensation Mundo Duplantis to gold.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-10-01",21.54,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fdf62f54cef0eab06215f3dbc7d8249fefc5a55/360_271_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0879b6eaae19914c451b1e7f178015dc","Adam Gemili slumps on the track after the race.

  ["Dire in Doha: world championships ‘catastrophe’ leaves athletics reeling","['Empty seats and ghostly silence have been the sad feature of this PR disaster for the sport, the IAAF, Lord Coe and Qatar']","['Moments after the greatest 10.83 seconds of Dina Asher-Smith’s life, the British sprinter grabbed a union flag from her mother, Julie, and began a lap of honour to celebrate her world championship 100m silver medal. But as she trotted round the 40,000-seat Khalifa stadium in Doha on Sunday night she was greeted by banks of empty seats and a ghostly silence.', 'Observers reckoned there were no more than 1,000 people still in attendance and many of them were journalists tapping away to deadline. Asher-Smith’s mother later tweeted she had seen more spectators at England Athletics’ age-group championships in Bedford.', 'Asher-Smith’s teammate Beth Dobbin was even more blunt. “I watched Dina’s victory lap and that was a bit heartbreaking because what she did was insane and there was no one there,” she said. “I feel like she was robbed of that moment.”', 'The organisers have since blamed the start of the working week and an event schedule designed for European TV audiences. But that cannot hide a simple fact. These world athletics championships have been a PR disaster for athletics, for the sport’s president, Sebastian Coe, and for Qatar, a country which has spent the past decade buying up rights to host major events, including the 2022 football World Cup.', 'Even Denise Lewis, the 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion who is not known for controversial views, has stuck the boot in, telling the BBC: “Our governing body has let our athletes down massively.” Meanwhile Eurosport, which holds Olympic TV rights across Europe, also mocked the lack of crowd for the women’s sprint final. “The Doha crowd roars with approval,” it tweeted with a gif of tumbleweed.', 'It is all a far cry from the promises made by Qatar in its first bid for these championships in 2011. “No empty seats,” the prospectus said, adding that “the atmosphere surrounding the world championships will be fantastic”.', 'That was a pledge that always looked spurious. But at least it was made several years ago. Coe, who was on the evaluation commission that inspected Doha’s bid for the 2019 championships and is reported to have later voted for it, said he hoped it would be “spectacular” just a few days ago.', 'Instead the stadium has often looked at least half empty, even though large parts of it have been covered with fabric and the capacity reduced to 21,000. And that is despite attendances being bolstered by organisers giving thousands of migrant workers from Africa and India free tickets.', 'On Monday they claimed that attendances had been “solid” for the first two days, at around 70%, but conceded “numbers were down on our expectations on day three with the start of the working week in Qatar”.', 'It added: “The challenge we face with a competition schedule that is geared to support global TV viewership is that some finals are not starting until the late evening. This impacts on the number of spectators remaining until the end of the session. We are confident that our renewed efforts will encourage the local community to come and witness the stunning performance of the world’s best athletes.', '“We know it is a balance and we are pleased global viewers can tune in to watch the live action from Doha.”', 'This, though, was a disaster foretold. After Doha was controversially awarded the championships – having offered £23.5m towards extra sponsorship and a promise to build 10 new tracks around the world minutes before the vote in 2014 when it defeated Eugene and Barcelona – the former IAAF board member Helmut Digel called it “incomprehensible”.', 'However José María Odriozola, a Spanish IAAF executive well-versed in the lingua franca of sports politics, cut to the heart of the matter. “All Doha have is money,” he said.', 'For many sports federations that is enough, whatever the athletes may think. Yet with every passing hour, more of them are voicing discontent. The French decathlete Kevin Mayer, the world record holder, has called the championships a “catastrophe”. Other athletes have claimed they are being treated as “guinea pigs” by a governing body that has forced marathon runners and race walkers to compete in 31C heat and high humidity, which has led to some being carried off the course in wheelchairs.', 'As Belarus’s Volha Mazuronak, who finished fifth in the women’s marathon in the early hours of Saturday morning, put it: “I thought I wouldn’t finish. It’s disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take the world championships here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.”', 'No one doubts that track and field has lost most of the momentum gained from the London 2017 world championships, which were watched by 750,000 people in the flesh and millions more on television. On Sunday evening Adam Gemili admitted it had been a “weird” event, adding: “It makes the British championships look quite good.” A colleague, the race walker Tom Bosworth, was even more cutting: “The only people carrying this sport are the athletes,” he said. “The IAAF truly should be ashamed.”', 'However, Coe continues to maintain that track and field must venture into new territories to help spread the word. Tell that to the 1,972 athletes from 208 countries here in Doha. For many this will be the pinnacle of their careers. How sad, then, that it has turned into a nadir for their sport.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-09-30",18.18,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df7f43f96f4bc0a6efde65c92170522a0f55fb4b/0_148_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=49920f6cc69450830201b89951066874","Dina Asher-Smith celebrated her lap of honour in front of empty seats at the world championships in Doha Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

Long live the king. Athletics has been scavenging around for someone to claim the world’s fastest man title since Usain Bolt’s retirement in 2017. In Christian Coleman, who blitzed to a stunning 100m gold medal here in Doha in 9.76sec, making him the sixth-fastest man in history, it has undoubtedly found him.', 'Some, like the legendary Michael Johnson, have suggested that the missed drugs tests that nearly derailed the 23-year-old American’s career last month might prevent him from becoming the face of his sport. But it is too late for that. For better or worse, that is what the softly spoken Coleman is now after claiming his first world title.', 'And long past midnight in the Khalifa International Stadium, he offered a spirited if sometimes odd defence of his reputation, repeatedly insisting he had not been careless despite missing a drugs test and two whereabouts failures in 12 months.', '“I guess you are insinuating something happened but I didn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “I haven’t been careless. Everyone in this room has not been perfect. I am just a young black man living my dream, people are trying to smear my reputation.', '“It is what it is, but I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing and focus on me,” he added. “Now I’m a world champion and that’s something that nobody can ever take away from me.”', 'Coleman was blunt on Johnson’s opinion too. “Michael Johnson doesn’t pay my bills and he doesn’t write my cheques,” he said. “I wouldn’t know who Michael Johnson was if he didn’t run fast times.”', 'The press conference was certainly more keenly contested than the final, which was done and dusted when Coleman established clear blue water over the field.', 'Justin Gatlin, who of course has a past of his own, ran faster than any 37-year-old in history to take silver in 9.89 while the Canadian Andre De Grasse was third in 9.90. But Britain’s Zharnel Hughes, who had been talked up as an outside medal prospect, was a disappointing sixth in 10.03.', '“My body wasn’t feeling up for it unfortunately,” admitted Hughes. “When I pushed out I was all over the place and I lost my form.', '“I was charged up for the race but as the gun banged I started feeling light headed for some reason and I tried my best to get composure and every time I tried to do something which was relaxing it just kept getting worse.”', 'This was the first major championships without Bolt since 2005, and the lack of crowds suggested the sport was missing its biggest star – and its greatest crutch. There has been much talk ever since on the need to jazz up the sport, and the IAAF certainly tried before the 100m final.', 'First the lights across the stadium went dark and the track lit up. Then disco music began to play and after the spotlight had focused on each athlete, the lights went back up and the sprinters were called to their blocks. The problem was that at this point the stadium was at least half empty, not that it bothered Coleman, who quickly blasted clear of the field.', 'Elsewhere the most exciting race of the night came in the women’s 10,000m as the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan reeled in a pack of Kenyans and Ethiopians before sprinting clear of Letesenbet Gidey on the final lap to win her first world title in 30:17.63. What made the achievement even more incredible was that the 26-year-old Hassan ran the final 1500m of the race in under four minutes.', 'The biggest shock, meanwhile, came in the men’s long jump as the Jamaican Tajay Gayle recorded the 10th-longest leap in history – breaking his personal best by 37cm – to win gold in 8.69m, well clear of Jeff Henderson, who took silver, and Juan Miguel Echevarría, who won bronze.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-09-28",20.53,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b61be7382273928e30da54c548e95393b445b0/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7dae96c3a2afdee36b0756bfbd5266f0","Christian Coleman celebrates his 100m win in Doha.

However, even with a reduced capacity and reasonable ticket prices starting at 60 Qatari rial (£13), seats are still readily available.', 'Sources have told the Guardian that 50,000 tickets have been sold across the 10 days of action – and that migrant workers and children will be bused in to stop the stadium appearing more than half-empty on TV. That is a far cry from the optimism displayed when tickets went on sale, with organisers promising that there had been “registrations of interest from literally all corners of the world”.', 'An IAAF spokesperson accepted ticket sales had been “challenging” but said nobody could have foreseen the boycott of Qatar by other gulf states, making it impossible for some fans in the region to watch the championships.', 'When asked about the possibility of tickets being given away, the spokesperson added: “Surely it is a good thing that communities across Qatar will be getting tickets?

Embracing their second-placed status in the car hire market behind Hertz, the American company told the world: “When you’re only No 2, you try harder. Or else.” That line perfectly encapsulates Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s mindset as she prepares for the World Athletics Championships in Doha, which begin this Friday.', 'The 26-year-old has won World and European Indoor gold medals as well as Commonwealth gold over the past 17 months yet remains the second-best heptathlete in the world, behind the brilliant Belgian Nafi Thiam. But in recent months the Liverpudlian has driven herself harder than ever and she believes she is in the best shape of her life. “I don’t like to say that, obviously, because you have to deliver,” she says, chuckling to herself. “But I have had the best run-in ever in terms of preparation and now I just want to get out there and compete.', '“As long as I am making progress in each of my events, with my personal bests, I feel I can score those scores to put me in those positions to win a gold medal. And I don’t think I have ever had one where everything comes together at once and that is what I am working towards.”', 'Typically the world championships take place in August in Europe or east Asia. But for the first time they are being held in the Middle East, in temperatures loitering around 38C (100F), and in a country with a questionable human rights record. However, Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, has defended the decision to go to Qatar, saying it is important athletics heads to new territories in order to grow. “I’ve never known a situation where sport going into a fresh and new type of territory hasn’t actually flicked the dial both socially, culturally and politically in a very positive way,” Lord Coe said.', 'If Great Britain do hit the seven-to-nine medals target set by UK Sport for these championships, it will surely be because a trident of brilliant women athletes – Dina Asher-Smith in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, Laura Muir in the 1500m and Johnson-Thompson – have led the way and the relays have once again come good.', 'If Johnson-Thompson were to succeed, there would surely not be a more popular winner in the GB team, given her tear-soaked disappointments at the 2015 and 2017 worlds. In 2015 in Beijing she was favourite for gold going into the second day, only to foul three times in the long jump. Two years later in London she bombed out in the high jump, dashing any hopes of a medal. In 2016 there was more pain at the Rio Olympics when injury robbed her of a legitimate chance of gold. But there is a growing sense that those disappointments are now firmly behind her after a move to Montpellier in 2017, which has toughened her up mentally and physically.', '“At the last worlds I was only a summer into my move to France and, while I knew the training was going well, I wasn’t settled in the slightest,” she says. “I also didn’t have any belief in myself because I was still recovering from the 2015 and 2016 seasons, but it seems like a lifetime ago now. I feel I am growing each year as a person. It is coming into a world championships and Olympics next year and I am happy with the place I am in.”', 'Yet Johnson-Thompson knows she faces a formidable six-foot high barrier in her quest for gold in Doha in the form of Thiam, the 25-year-old who is arguably the best athlete across any sport. After all Thiam is not only good enough to have cleared 2.02m in the high jump (putting her second best in the world in 2019) but also to have a 6.86m personal best in the long jump (the ninth best of any woman this year). Her javelin best would put her in the world’s top 50 and she is no slouch in the 100m hurdles, shot put, 200m or 800m either.', '“She is very strong in a lot of events now,” Johnson-Thompson says. “We have seen her jump 2.02m and throw 59m with the javelin. She is definitely pushing me but I am not sure about the other way around.”', 'With two of Johnson-Thompson’s big rivals for the podium, Carolin Schäfer of Germany and Latvia’s Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, absent through injury it looks a straight shoot-out between Britain and Belgium for gold. Thiam is favourite but there is a question mark over an elbow that was injured earlier this summer and that gives Johnson‑Thompson legitimate hope. Whatever happens in Doha, she is determined to compete with a smile on her face. “It has been a long season but I am coming into shape at the right time,” she says. “I think I will enjoy every second of it.”']","Katarina Johnson-Thompson","Sport","2019-09-21",21.59,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2c22247ce4c2a65efa9eae392578eab6a8bb50/0_200_4806_2884/master/4806.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0669a084f12e95d07762a1ace001f14c","Katarina Johnson-Thompson: ‘I feel I can score those scores to put me in those positions to win a gold medal.’ Photograph: Robert Broger/Getty Images","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

During the final laps, Verstappen had overtaken Hamilton but was obliged to hand the place back immediately, because he had gone beyond the track limits at turn four during the manoeuvre.', 'He and Red Bull immediately accepted the instruction from race control was correct, because the Dutchman had gained a “lasting advantage” in passing, but there was considerable controversy over the confusing application of the rules during the race at the same corner, where it appeared Hamilton had been gaining an advantage by taking the wide line.', 'Hamilton had been taking the wider, faster line on the understanding that it was acceptable because of the FIA instruction that track limits would not be monitored for lap times at that corner. Horner believes Hamilton’s line may have been worth as much as two-tenths of a second per lap. However, Hamilton was warned by the FIA over taking that wider line in mid-race.', 'Horner argued that there should be no room for interpretation in how the rules are applied. “With these track limit things, they’re always going to be contentious,” he said. “But we do need to just have a consistent situation. You can’t say: ‘It’s OK to use it in the race, but you can’t overtake out there.’ It should be black or white, it should not be shades of grey.”', 'Wolff agreed, citing the complexity of the instructions drivers and teams receive. “We need to be consistent in which messages are being given,” he said. “They need to be clear, they need to be sacred and not a Shakespeare novel that leaves interpretation.”', 'When Hamilton was informed he would face a warning and then potentially a penalty he stopped going wide but questioned why the rule had apparently changed mid-race.', 'The FIA race director, Michael Masi, insisted that the rules had not changed. He explained that the rules that stated turn four would not be monitored also warned drivers were not permitted to gain an advantage by going wide. However, that ‘advantage’ appears to mean in the context of overtaking or defending rather than lap time: certainly that seems to be how the majority of teams interpreted it.', 'More straightforward and clearly defined instructions for drivers were required, insisted Wolff. “At the beginning of the race it was said track limits in turn four wouldn’t be sanctioned,” he said. “Then in the race suddenly we heard that if you would continue to run wide it would be seen as an advantage and could cause a potential penalty.', '“The lesson of this is it needs to be simple, so everybody can understand it and they don’t need to carry the document in the car to read it and remind themselves what actually is allowed and what not.”']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-29",17.46,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a486dec8fa49d455410f2272cb1bd8d762c268ee/0_172_3817_2290/master/3817.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=817d90d728f082c3a07cab0b40490c73","Max Verstappen (front) leads Lewis Hamilton at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

  ["F1 close to agreement on trio of sprint qualifying races in 2021 season","['Decision could be confirmed at Imola next weekend', 'Finishing order of sprint race will determine grid placings']","['Formula One is expected to soon confirm it will adopt three sprint qualifying races this season as a test for the format. The teams are understood to have come to an agreement on the potential financial implications of the move and an announcement is expected shortly, once the remaining technical details are ironed out. The decision could be confirmed as early as the next round at Imola next weekend.', 'The proposal of hosting a sprint race to replace qualifying on a Saturday has been under discussion for some time. F1’s owners, Liberty Media, were keen to try the new format as a way of providing greater spectacle for fans and with the finishing order deciding the grid for the grand prix on Sunday potentially mixing up the pecking order of the teams.', 'There had been considerable debate on the subject, with the teams willing to give it a try but intent on ensuring that its implementation was acceptable. The format adopted and intended to be trialled this season at Silverstone, Monza and Interlagos, would consist of a race of approximately one-third race distance, around 100km. The grid for the sprint will be decided by a qualifying session on Friday. A small number of points will be awarded but principally it will decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.', 'One of the major concerns for the teams was that it would have serious financial implications, especially in the first year that a budget cap has been imposed. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, made clear his concerns at the season-opener in Bahrain.', '“What we can’t ignore is that to run and operate these cars is extremely expensive,” he said. “We need to find a solution how to combat that, in particular in a season where the budget cap is having a significant impact on how we operate.”', 'Those financial concerns have now been resolved. Agreement has been reached on meeting the extra costs and to cover potential damage incurred. Details on tyre usage and the adjustment to the DRS usage to increase overtaking remain under discussion. A formal agreement is expected within weeks, either at Imola or the following Portuguese Grand Prix.', 'F1 and the teams have been in agreement that the races, to be known as “spring qualifying”, do not detract from the grand prix on a Sunday. F1’s new chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, insisted that: “We do not want to take away the prestige of the grand prix itself. That will remain the climax of the weekend.” There will be no podium ceremony and it will not count as a “grand prix” win.', 'With the Australian and Chinese GPs postponed already this year, Imola was drafted in to host its second GP in two years next week for the rather ungainly-named Gran Premio Del Made In Italy E Dell’emilia Romagna.

  ["F1 rising star Yuki Tsunoda: ‘Every other driver is the enemy’","['AlphaTauri’s Japanese rookie has brought dash and verve to F1 and is unfazed by sharing a grid with a host of world champions']","['There is a joyful exuberance to Yuki Tsunoda that is almost magnetic. The Japanese driver has brought dash and verve to Formula One and has been unafraid to pepper it with expletives. Refreshingly the 20-year-old, one of F1’s most exciting prospects, is unrepentant. ', 'His rise has been positively meteoric but tangling at the sharper end of a grid populated by four world champions and some exceptional talent besides holds no fears for Tsunoda. “When I am racing I do not think about them,” he says without hesitation at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari before this weekend’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. “Every driver is the same for me, they are the enemy. I don’t think about whether they are world champions or that it is an honour to race them, not when I am driving.”', 'After only one race Tsunoda has drawn plaudits from across the paddock. He scored points on his debut for AlphaTauri at the season opener in Bahrain. His driving caught the attention as did his occasional swearing over team radio; F1 apparently shocked at a young man venting publicly with such unabashed brio.', 'Tsunoda, who grew up in Sagamihara City, chuckles gently – surprised at the interest his colourful grasp of English has attracted – but sees no reason to neuter his character behind the wheel.', '“When I am gaming with my friends I swear a lot in my house in Japan,” he says. “I go more crazy than in racing – like throwing the controller – I made two holes already in my apartment. I broke a couple of things which is double stress for me. In racing I always have passion, I am more serious about the racing so it’s easy to swear but at the same time I am really focused.”', 'His former team boss in F2, Trevor Carlin from the Carlin team, even offered his belated apologies to the AlphaTauri principal Franz Tost, albeit tinged with pride. “Yuki has spent a year with a bunch of British mechanics learning all the British swear words,” he says. “Which I think Franz was a bit shocked about with Yuki effing and blinding on the radio. But he genuinely enjoys racing, he is fiercely loyal, he will embed himself in the team really well and is like a sponge for knowledge.”', 'F1 needs characters and Tsunoda is a breath of fresh air, with an infectious enthusiasm backed by talent, ambition and a mature work ethic. In Bahrain, with AlphaTauri enjoying a very competitive car, he started from 13th, made a poor opening lap and dropped to 17th before coming back strongly to claim ninth. His performance was lauded, not least in becoming the first Japanese driver to score points since Kamui Kobayashi in 2012.', 'Tsunoda began karting when he was four and encouraged by his father continued doing it for fun until he was 10 when he began to take driving seriously. He was taken on by Honda in 2016 and competed in two full seasons of Japanese F4 in 2017 and 2018 when Red Bull made him part of their junior driver programme. He then spent one season in F3, graduating to F2 in 2020 before promotion to AlphaTauri this year.', 'His rise has been remarkable but reflective of his talent. He is fiercely competitive. At Bahrain his comeback included a dive past Fernando Alonso for a place and mugging Lance Stroll on the last lap to clinch ninth. It was celebrated but in character for Tsunoda. In the final race of last year’s F2 season at Bahrain he similarly passed Dan Ticktum on the final corner of the final lap to take second place. Tsunoda is relentless. “He never gives up, he fights to the very, very end,” Carlin notes.', 'Tsunoda has come this far under no little pressure. Red Bull’s director of motorsport, Helmut Marko, has set hard targets for him to reach in order to be retained. Unsurprisingly he has shown an extraordinary ability to learn and improve with alacrity.', 'His F3 year was his first living outside Japan and even with an uncompetitive team, he managed to win a race. In F2, Marko had mandated a top-three finish which Carlin believed was a tall order for any rookie until he saw how good the Japanese driver was. Indeed he is convinced that Tsunoda could have won the title, he was the top rookie and the absence of errors was notable. If it had been decided on the feature length races alone – those most similar to F1 – he would have done so and he did secure third.', 'At his F1 debut, however, he made his mark on a much grander palette. F1’s director of motorsport, Ross Brawn, described him as the “best rookie F1 has had for years, fairly stunning in whatever series he has competed in”. Even the notoriously hard to impress Marko was moved to offer high praise. “We are convinced Tsunoda will be the first Japanese driver to win an F1 grand prix,” he said. “His mentality is also great, he has incredible self-confidence. I am convinced we will see him on the podium soon.”', 'It seems Tsunoda has it all. He is unafraid to throw his car into a pass but has the maturity required to ensure his skills progress. “We only had to explain something to him once and he would go and do it – the perfect pupil,” says Carlin. “Race craft is one of his greatest strengths. It is very rare to find a driver who can apply what they are told immediately, some think they know better, some just can’t do it, some don’t understand but Yuki just went and applied it. He is the full package, he really is. I am convinced he will be on the podium this year. He is just born to be a racing driver, he finds it very easy to deliver. The sky is the limit for him.”', 'Tsunoda will be confident this weekend at Imola, a track where he has tested extensively. This is a home race for AlphaTauri whose Faenza base is only 12 miles away and there is a sense that despite coming so far, so fast, this is only the beginning of something special. Certainly Tsunoda’s enthusiasm remains unbridled and long may it remain so.', '“I always come to the track to go faster, of course that puts more pressure on me but that pressure works well to focus,” he says. “People think I was happy to score my first points, I was happy but I was thinking more about what I could improve. I knew I could have got a better result in Bahrain, the car was there and top five was easily possible. I have some regrets and a lot of things to learn, even immediately after the race I was thinking: ‘Where can I improve?’”', 'Valtteri Bottas led his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in first practice at Imola, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third. The top three were closely matched, separated by only five-hundredths of a second. In the afternoon Verstappen suffered a setback, losing almost the entire session when he came to a halt with a driveshaft problem. Bottas was on top once more, one-hundredth ahead of Hamilton, with Tsunoda an impressive seventh.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-04-16",15.58,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c14b651dbd805d53ebafdc53423ad2ca6e64d9/0_8_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&fit=max&s=f39aa736eb744000ec71b23a70bb1508","Yuki Tsunoda of AlphaTauri prepares for practice at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.

  ["Callum Smith prepares for fight of his life against Saul 'Canelo' Álvarez","['Unbeaten Liverpudlian towers over the Mexican, who he faces in Texas on Sunday, but the odds remain against him']","['Saul “Canelo” Álvarez is more than a fighter, he’s an industry. And, for all the restrictions of the pandemic and boxing politics, business is still good – as Callum Smith has recently discovered.', 'Late on Saturday in San Antonio, Texas (early Sunday morning GMT), they will argue over the unbeaten Liverpudlian’s WBA “super” super-middleweight title as the incomparable Mexican reaches for a world championship to go with his several belts at light-middle, middleweight and light-heavyweight gathered over nearly a decade in a 56-fight career that began as a teenager 15 years ago.', 'For all the credentials of other excellent contemporaries such as Terence Crawford, Nayoya Inoue, Errol Spence Jr and Oleksandr Usyk, the red-headed 30-year-old phenomenon from Guadalajara bears favourable comparison with Julio César Chávez, who terrorised the best in his business over three weights in the last two decades of the 20th century.', 'Smith, also 30, brings his own spotless CV to Texas at short notice, and, although he is acknowledged as pre-eminent at 12 stone, he is talking like a fighter privileged to be sharing a little piece of hell with a boxing nightmare. Neither has fought for over a year; they are about to make up for lost time and revenue.', 'In this millennium, only Floyd Mayweather Jr (to whom he lost in 2013) has had greater commercial clout than Álvarez, who chose Smith – not the other way around – giving the champion a mere month to prepare and travel to his turf. A purse of $40m when the fight was first mooted before lockdowns gripped the world has probably shrunk to a quarter of that, with Álvarez likely to pocket the bigger slice.', 'In the Alamodome, a stadium just over a mile from the battle where Davy Crockett simultaneously perished at the hands of Mexico’s General Santa Anna and was confirmed as an American wild west hero, Smith knows he is in for the fight of his life. He has to put aside the brief preparation he has been allowed, and said: “There’s plenty of different ways to get in shape. It hasn’t been ideal, but you make do with what you’ve got, and I’m in very good shape.”', 'There won’t be more than a scattering of citizens inside a biosecure stadium that holds up to 64,000 fans, but the tension and sense of occasion will be considerable, nonetheless.', 'In normal circumstances, Smith would be preparing for Christmas back in Liverpool inside an altogether more welcoming bubble of his three boxing brothers and their close family. He might have contemplated a mid-winter round of golf at Wallasey, where he has performed enthusiastically. Álvarez is a keen golfer, too, but their skills are now trained on a more dangerous pursuit.', 'When they faced off for the first time at the venue this week, Smith towered over Álvarez by fully half a foot at 6ft 3in, and he invests his rangy frame with power that has proved too much for 19 of his 27 opponents, including George Groves to secure his title two years ago.', 'None of his experiences will match this one, though. It was not of his making, but he is happy with that. As Álvarez said: “We chose Callum Smith because he’s ranked No 1 in the 168lb division. And, in the end, that’s what I want. I have a strong mindset. I know how to handle all of this.” He certainly does.', 'In 2018, DAZN signed Álvarez to a 12-fight contract worth $365m – nearly $180m more than it cost to build the venue in which they are fighting. This year, though, it turned ugly. DAZN, Eddie Hearn’s streaming partner, wanted their star to take a pay cut because of the coronavirus, he argued with his long-time promoters at Golden Boy and they went their separate ways. However, after some hard talking, DAZN got back in the Álvarez business, alongside Matchroom, Hearn and Smith.', 'As far as any respected historian can determine, Álvarez is the first boxer to fight brothers in world title fights at different weights, having cut up and stopped Callum’s brother, Liam, in nine rounds at light-middle in 2016. The Mexican earlier repulsed worthy British challenges by Matthew Hatton, Ryan Rhodes and Amir Khan.', 'There can be no doubting Smith’s determination or ability to stop the rot, although he is a 4-1 underdog. For maybe half an hour in San Antonio, he gets his own Battle of the Alamo, and a rearguard Liverpool victory would be the biggest upset of recent times; if Smith finishes upright, he will have given Álvarez a serious fright, and that alone would be a memorable achievement.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-12-18",15.08,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556f45a120a227572bbe2c57d47d68a85ee95255/77_277_3347_2009/master/3347.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=b9953b32f4245ea5c799aea7776f4979","The pandemic has meant Callum Smith has had a reduced preparation period for Sunday’s fight.

If Smith were to spring the upset of the year, an all-British fight with Saunders would be a distinct possibility next summer, says Eddie Hearn, but Álvarez is the target for everyone at or around super-middleweight.', 'After outpointing the 38-year-old Murray, 120-109 twice and 118-110 in the third defence of his title, Saunders said: “I’ve just turned 31. I’m in my prime. I’ve been out a year and probably needed the rounds. It’s very important for me to stay in the gym now, because I’m not getting any younger.”', 'Hearn, his promoter, said: “The deal was done with Canelo and it was a massive blow when it was called off. We can’t waste the opportunity to find out how good Billy is, but he’s not yet mixing with the elite of the elite: [Gennady] Golovkin, Canelo, Smith.”', 'Murray hinted he would retire, revealing he had hurt his back two weeks before the fight, an injury which flared in the eighth round, but said: “I lost to the better man.” He will surely join the likes of Herol Graham and Kevin Mitchell as among the best British fighters never to win a world title, but he came desperately close, especially against the outstanding Sergio Martínez in Argentina in 2013.', 'Murray also took Golovkin 11 rounds, drew with Felix Sturm and lost a split decision to Arthur Abraham, all of them outstanding fighters. Saunders, though, had his measure in nearly every round.', '“He’s a cunning old fox,” Saunders said. “He got through it and fair play to him. I hope he has a good Christmas.”', 'Hearn was right to point out that Saunders was hard on himself after an impressive display against one of British boxing’s best. There were no knockdowns, although Saunders reckoned he deserved one when Murray went over in the fourth; it was ruled a slip.', 'If a crowd had been allowed, they would have given both fighters a standing ovation at the end but, as Saunders pointed out, “it was like fighting in a cemetery”.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-12-04",23.45,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93413db50e29c6292eb8f4aeee27626ef50c4b9c/0_349_6738_4044/master/6738.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=27717246c719ae8fc033694f797ed8bc","Billy Joe Saunders forces Martin Murray on the defensive during their WBO super-middleweight title fight at Wembley Arena.

I love and miss it'","['The 47-year-old promoter on his preparations for a comeback after 12 years out of the ring and why his young lightweight hope Ryan García will be an even bigger star than himself']","['It has always been tough to tell if Oscar De La Hoya is smiling because he feels blessed to be alive or because he has something to sell. With teeth as white as his it is as easy to fix a grin as not and in pandemic-gripped boxing, there has not been much to smile about.', 'In a Zoom conversation from his home in California, the Golden Boy smiles pretty much from start to finish. He has two items to sell, as it happens: his unbeaten young lightweight, Ryan García, who fights Luke Campbell for the interim WBC lightweight title in Dallas on Saturday, and himself.', 'After declaring García could be a bigger star than he was, De La Hoya confirms he wants to box again, perhaps against Gennady Golovkin. Before GGG’s successful extension of his own career this month, he all but threatened to kill De La Hoya if they shared a ring. They have history. This, surely, was not a good career move for someone who turns 48 in February and has not fought in 12 years.', 'He generated $700m as a fighter and it is said he has hung on to more than $200m of it. So money should not be an issue. “It is a serious proposition. The main reason is because I love it and I miss it,” he says, beaming like a man given the choice of reliving his past or listening to Barry Manilow for the rest of his life.', 'A Golovkin fight is wildly optimistic. Even at 38, he is formidable enough coming off an excellent win over the younger, unbeaten Kamil Szeremeta to stay in the mix for a third fight with boxing’s pound-for-pound best, Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez – whom De La Hoya promoted until they split this year.', '“Golovkin is a very strong fighter, but I’ve always said if he fights Canelo one more time, he’s very, very vulnerable, because Canelo looked amazing [beating Callum Smith in 12 one-sided rounds]. He looked fast, he looked strong. Doesn’t throw enough punches, like [Julio] César Chávez, but he gets the job done. But, yes, he is a consideration, Golovkin.”', 'Once a fighter, always a fighter? “Exactly!”', 'Except that is only true in the imagination. What De La Hoya is contemplating is public self-destruction to scratch an itch – which is why he came out of retirement to fight Manny Pacquiao in 2008 and got his butt kicked for the seven rounds it lasted.', '“For the last maybe six, seven months I’ve been feeling great,” he says. “My body fat is very low. I’m maybe 10 pounds [from] where I want to be. Right now I’m 170. I just want to make sure that when I start sparring I don’t get injured.”', 'De La Hoya is inspired by Mike Tyson’s exhibition “draw” against Roy Jones Jr a month ago, 15 years after Kevin McBride finished his real career. “What Mike Tyson did was very inspirational,” he says. “He looked great. He looked like the old Mike Tyson, against a fighter who at one point was the best on the planet.”', 'The screaming caveat is “at one point was”. De La Hoya concedes Tyson’s reflexes “were a little off” but adds: “If you give your body, your mind, your soul enough time to prepare for a fight you can do it – if you’re injury-free.”', 'Oscar’s world is full of ifs. But he draws strength from another legend who briefly did come back, albeit in better circumstances. Before Sugar Ray Leonard beat Marvin Hagler in 1987, he spent 12 months having real fights behind closed doors, with 10oz gloves and no headgear to simulate the feel of combat again.', '“I would do [that]. I would stage some real fights in the gym, no headgear, smaller gloves – just to make sure everything is OK. It would be against a real fighter, an active fighter. I fought the very best in the prime of my career, so I wouldn’t do any different.”', 'In a 16-year career that persuaded The Ring magazine to rate him the 14th of all time, De La Hoya outclassed the best of his era: César Chávez (twice), Pernell Whitaker, Héctor Camacho, Ike Quartey, Rafael Ruelas and Genaro Hernández among many others. Only the best beat him: Felix Trinidad, Shane Mosley (twice), Bernard Hopkins, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Pacquiao. In victory and defeat, age played a part. It always does.', 'Back in the real world, he sees the striking similarities between himself and García, a Californian Mexican with flashing fists, good looks and an astonishing fanbase. “He’s a very confident young kid with a lot of abilities. I strongly feel Ryan García is probably the hardest worker in boxing today. He loves what he does. He knows what he wants – and I believe he’s gonna be successful at it.”', 'There is growing sentiment García, whose fight with Campbell is live on streaming channel DAZN, could be everything De La Hoya says he will be. But there are traps, as De La Hoya discovered, distracted at the height of his celebrity. “It’s extremely difficult when the whole world is telling you you’re going to be great. I believe he’s destined to become the most popular fighter on the planet. He only has, like, 7.5m [Instagram] followers at the tender age of 22, so I imagine when he’s like Canelo, at 30 years of age, [he will] have 30, 40 million followers, easily.', '“Everybody is talking about how special he’s gonna be and how special he is. I’m thinking as a fighter now, if I were in his position, I would feel a little nervous, maybe a little: ‘Wow, am I going to live up to this expectation? It makes me work harder, it makes me focus more on what I want to accomplish over the years.’ That pressure is going to lead him to become great. He’s a big 135-pounder. I believe he can get up to 154 … maybe 160?”', 'De La Hoya, as promoter, is bound to acknowledge Campbell will be a worthy challenger, given the 33-year-old Yorkshireman has mixed at a much higher level as a professional over a far longer time and comes to the contest bursting with confidence.', '“Luke Campbell is a very, very dangerous fighter for anyone. He has an Olympic gold medal, he’s very dedicated, devoted to his craft. Luke Campbell is the same height as Ryan García. He’s a southpaw, he’s gonna present some problems. It’s not gonna be easy. Ryan has to be on his A-game.”', 'De La Hoya’s smile illuminates our Zoom farewell and I’m left wondering if it is still there after he clicks the “leave” button, a blunt metaphor for his boxing life.

But it is typical of the heavyweight that when he woke up and discovered his brother Dean had intervened to stop the dramatic incident he wished he had got involved.', '“I didn’t know what Dean had done,” he said. “I was asleep. I’d trained and jumped on the plane so I was a bit tired. When I woke up I heard all about it. I was disappointed he didn’t hit the guy, I would have just knocked him out, to be honest, because that’s no joking matter. My brother gave him a chance but I would have knocked him out clean. I probably would have hit him on the floor as well.”', 'For someone who relishes a tear-up Whyte has barely laced up his gloves in anger since beating Óscar Rivas in July, due to an adverse finding in a UK Anti-Doping sample. The case is still unresolved, although he has been cleared to fight. He laughs when it is suggested his brother is getting more fights than him at the moment – but the frustration is evident too.', '“It’s been stressful and a few times I’ve thought about walking away from boxing and jacking it in,” admitted Whyte. “I’m not someone to talk about my emotions, but I have been stressed and down and depressed. But my team kept pushing me, urging me to go to the gym and taking the mickey out of me, saying my belly was getting bigger.', '“I’m a very strong person mentally and physically, but without my team I would have walked away from boxing without a doubt.”', 'But at least one cloud is lifting. On Saturday he returns to the ring to face Mariusz Wach on the undercard of the Andy Ruiz Jnr v Anthony Joshua rematch.', '“Wach is gonna get whacked,” said Whyte. “He’s very experienced and he knows how to survive. He’s got a very good jab. So it’s up to me to go in there and bring maximum pain, as I do. I will be trying to knock him out.', '“The last few months have been tough. But you know me, it doesn’t take much to get me in a fight. And I will come to the ring with maximum violent intentions.”', 'Whyte’s only defeat in 27 fights has come at the hands of Joshua and, as he points out, he has also spent more than 600 days as the No 1 contender with the WBC. “Never in the history of heavyweight boxing has someone been mandatory contender for so long,” Whyte laments. “Except maybe Jack Johnson and Sonny Liston.”', 'He hopes he will cross paths again with Joshua, who he beat in the amateurs, for a decider. “We both respect each other but it’s a weird thing,” he said. “It’s like we hate each other, but respect each other. It’s just a job.”', 'He also expects Joshua to regain his WBA, IBF and WBO titles against Ruiz. “Hopefully his head is in the right space and he doesn’t listen to all this negativity because as a country we like bringing each other down too much,” he said. “Someone loses, ‘ah he was rubbish, he was no good’. You weren’t saying that a few months ago when he was heavyweight champion of the world. None of his critics are going to be hall of fame. He will.”', 'As for Whyte himself, he is quietly hopeful of getting his career back on track. “Boxing is a very dark, muddy, murky waters,” he says. “One day you’re floating and the next day you’re sinking. I’ve learnt a lot of lessons from boxing. It’s made me stronger as a person and given me a better life.”', 'He smiles again. “Life is hard, man. But two things I know are to be brave and to fight.

  ["Andy Ruiz Jr denies becoming complacent since Anthony Joshua fight","[' Ruiz promises to be slicker and faster in Saturday’s rematch']","['Andy Ruiz Jr has denied becoming complacent since shocking the world to become the heavyweight champion – and promised he will be slicker and faster for Saturday night’s rematch with Anthony Joshua.', 'Ruiz celebrated winning the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight belts by buying five cars – including two types of Mercedes G-Class, a Rolls Royce and a Lamborghini as well as a truck for his parents – but says his competitive fire rages brighter than ever. While the Mexican-American expects Joshua to come in much lighter in their second fight in a bid to outmanoeuvre him, he predicts another stoppage.', '“We’ve been training on being small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch,” Ruiz said. “I know he is going to try to box me around, that’s why he has lost some weight. He’ll try to keep me away with the jab but that’s exactly what we’ve been practising for.', '“I think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up. He’s not good enough to avoid me for the full 12 rounds on the back foot. We’ve been working on this for around three months now and I know, whatever he brings, we will be ready for it.”', 'Ruiz admitted that part of his tactics have involved enraging Joshua by calling him a quitter for spitting out his gumshield in their first fight. “I am pretty sure he was mad at me,” he said, “but that is what I felt in my heart, he spat his mouthpiece out and quit.', '“I respect the man outside the ring. I would always hug him and shake his hand, so it’s all about respect. But I want him to be mad and swinging in the ring, I want him to have that attitude because I will be calm and know exactly what we need to do.”', 'Ruiz, who expects to weigh just over 19st again as he did for the first fight with Joshua, also revealed he had been talking to the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, about a unification fight. “Me and Wilder actually talk on the phone, we are good friends,” he said. “We know what is in the plan.”']","Boxing","Sport","2019-12-05",22.3,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7ac5708d11760ef358a3961ad275efa4f10709/0_140_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=72e57ad6aaf95cb4c307aa1a2f026261","Andy Ruiz Jr said of Anthony Joshua: ‘He’s not good enough to avoid me for the full 12 rounds on the back foot.’ Photograph: Nick Potts/PA","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

  ["Andy Ruiz Jr's plan to make Anthony Joshua's height work against him","['The Mexican-American giant-killer, who cut his teeth fighting bigger opponents, says the Briton’s style is perfect for him']","['The superficial differences in the physiques of Andy Ruiz Jr and Anthony Joshua were laid bare even more dramatically than six months ago at Friday’s weigh-in on a sun-splashed afternoon outside the Al Faisaliyah Centre in downtown Riyadh.', 'The doughy Ruiz came in at 20st 3lb (283lb) for Saturday’s rematch, more than a stone above the svelte-for-him 268lb of their encounter in June, while the slimmed-down yet still-sculpted Joshua weighed 16st 3lb (237lb), down 10 pounds from the worst night of his boxing life.', 'Yet the physical disadvantages Ruiz will face at the Diriyah Arena on the north-west outskirts of the Saudi capital – four inches in height, eight inches in reach with a body mass index breaking the scale – are hardly different than those he overcame the first time when he overwhelmed Joshua for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles at Madison Square Garden.', 'That was no fluke. No “punch from the gods” that can be explained away. After showing otherworldly punch resistance after coming back from a heavy knockdown in the third round, Ruiz’s deceptively quick hand speed and in-fighting made the upright champion look basic – and offered a compelling case for why the Mexican-American nicknamed the Destroyer appears to be a stylistic nightmare for a tall-and-straight puncher such as Joshua.', '“I think his style was just perfect for me and I think [Saturday] will be the same,” Ruiz said this week. “I think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up.', '“That is exactly what we have been training on. Being small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch. I know he is going to try to box me around, that is why he lost some weight, he will try to keep me away with the jab. But that’s what we have been practising for.”', 'The initial efforts to make sense of Ruiz’s shock upset – a stunner that ranks alongside Buster Douglas v Mike Tyson and James Braddock v Max Baer among the most seismic in the division’s lengthy annals – pointed toward the superior amateur pedigree of the 30-year-old from south-eastern California, who banked nearly three times as many fights and a decade more experience in the unpaid ranks as the late-starting Joshua.', 'Yet a closer inspection of these formative years offers further insight into Ruiz’s giant-killing ways: he has been cutting his teeth on bigger guys nearly his entire life.', 'Ruiz was 12st 8lb (180lb) at nine years old, which led his father to put him in with older kids who could handle the youngster’s unique blend of size and speed. He was made to spar with professionals often twice his age on those endless trips across the US-Mexico border to train at gyms in Mexicali, where he became accustomed to problem-solving against opponents far bigger than him.', 'Andy Ruiz Sr recalls the way he got the attention of Freddie Roach when he first made the 200-mile journey from Imperial to Los Angeles to train for the Mexican Olympic trials at the Wild Card boxing club, getting the best of a series of the famed trainer’s professional heavyweights when he was still a teenager.', '“He beat the shit out of Javier Mota, a much taller Mexican, who had 24 fights and one loss at the time,” the elder Ruiz said. “He knocked that guy down when he was 16 years old.”', 'Jorge Muñoz, who runs the Sparta boxing gym in El Centro where Ruiz came of age and still occasionally trains, believes the seeds planted during those Wild Card sessions more than a decade ago came into full bloom when their hometown hero got the chance of a lifetime against Joshua. “You could see all the stuff they taught him to fight the big guys, all those tricks about putting the forehand on their neck, hitting them in the forehead.” Muñoz said. “Those little details work for him because he’s always been in with guys who are taller. He knows how to work inside and over [in Europe] they don’t know how to work inside.”', 'Muñoz added: “It’s the Mexican style: body shots and uppercuts. Andy has a crazy jab to the stomach and Joshua is not used to getting hit right there. If you watch all his fights, nobody ever hits him there, because he’s fought all those guys from over there who are just one-two, one-two [to the head] and nothing with the body.”', 'Joshua will attempt to become only the fourth deposed heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch after Floyd Patterson (against Ingemar Johansson in 1960), Muhammad Ali (against Leon Spinks in 1978) and Lennox Lewis (against Hasim Rahman in 2001).', 'A greater number have failed in the task, among them Jersey Joe Walcott (both to Rocky Marciano), Patterson (both to Sonny Liston), Larry Holmes (both to Michael Spinks) and Mike Tyson (both to Evander Holyfield).', 'Muñoz believes six months is too quick a turnaround for Joshua to absorb the necessary lessons.', '“I think it’s too short notice,” he said. “Joshua already knows how he could beat him, by jabbing and moving around, but Andy already knows what he needs to do. When Joshua won the gold medal, he fought from the outside. But that’s all amateur. Eventually a pro gets in there and it’s about how you work on the inside.”', 'Ruiz’s father, who says he won $50,000 betting on his son to defeat Joshua when they first met, said he is even more confident for Saturday’s showdown – even if it looks as if he has enjoyed a few too many cheat days at hometown favourites Johnny’s Burritos and Donut Avenue. “We’re going to win the fight.”']","Boxing","Sport","2019-12-07",10,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37887869748cb464fb3d42a664230c20c1fd8230/0_122_3265_1960/master/3265.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=79b3019c56ad015c500856544e033497","Andy Ruiz Jr (right) lands a punch on Anthony Joshua at Madison Square Garden in June.

  ["England head for Rome and day of destiny with new gladiators","['Eddie Jones has picked four debutants for the visit to Italy, where England hope to win a first Six Nations title since 2017 ']","['It is not often that a team hoping to close out a Six Nations title on the final weekend includes four uncapped players among its glory hunters. The England side heading to Rome may now have an appropriately ancient and modern feel but there is also less certainty in some key areas than there might be.', 'While Ben Youngs, who will win his 100th England cap, seems to have been around almost as long as the Colosseum, the same cannot be said of Jonny Hill, Tom Dunn, Ollie Thorley and Ollie Lawrence, the four new red rose gladiators strapping on their breastplates on Saturday. With two specialist outside centres together in midfield, no specialist reserve 10 and the lack of a warmup game, very little can be entirely guaranteed.', 'Eddie Jones, though, used an interesting word as he expanded on his selection for England’s first game since March. “The players have approached this camp with a zest for the game I have never seen before,” suggested the head coach, who has been around a few blocks in his long career. The obvious hope is that enthusiasm and pent-up energy will make up for a conspicuous lack, in some cases, of recent club form.', 'The desire to achieve a suitable result for Youngs and hooker Jamie George, who will earn his 50th England cap, will certainly be strong. Both are hugely popular squad members who remain just as approachable and grounded as they were at the outset of their careers, a genuine credit to their respective clubs – Leicester and Saracens – and their families.', 'But even as head coach Eddie Jones was singing Youngs’s praises – “At his best he’s close to the best half-back in the world … he is an important, infectious character in our squad” – he was also clearly mindful England need to remain switched on after swapping their Teddington “bubble” for the Italian capital where demonstrations against the latest Covid-19 restrictions, including a 6pm curfew for bars and restaurants, have intensified this week.The eerie backdrop will be a far cry from the convivial, laidback atmosphere of a traditional Rome Six Nations weekend, with thousands of travelling English supporters enjoying la dolce vita. The final weekend maths also dictate that England will have to click properly into gear for a large chunk of the game to claim a first championship title since 2017. The last three English visits to Rome have yielded winning margins of 31, 31 and 41 points respectively and something similar may be required again if Ireland or France are to be edged out on points difference.Central to any backline fluency, in particular, will be the way Owen Farrell, Henry Slade and Jonathan Joseph dovetail at 10-12-13, with Slade invited to fill the gaping hole left by the injured Manu Tuilagi while Farrell shifts to 10 for the unavailable George Ford. All now have plenty of experience but Slade has been otherwise engaged winning trophies with Exeter until last weekend and Farrell has not played since being sent off against Wasps almost eight weeks ago.', 'George Furbank at full-back also still has a bit to prove after a tricky start to his international career but Jones remains an admirer and even reckons the Northampton player has the attributes to slot in as a 10 if required. If Farrell were to go down in a heap in the opening minutes, however, it is more likely Jones would look to Slade, who has played a fair amount at fly-half in the past if not much lately. Should the strong-running Lawrence and Thorley also make it on to the field in the second half, it will turn into a very unfamiliar-looking English backline indeed.', 'Either way, it is up front where England’s coaches will be aiming to exert serious pressure and, in the process, give an armchair chariot ride to their centurion Youngs. Rome may already have seven hills but this weekend it will have an eighth, standing 6ft 7in tall and fresh from a European and Premiership double with Exeter.', 'Jonny Hill did make it on to England’s bench once before, as a non-playing replacement in Cape Town in 2018, but he reckons he is better prepared now: “I’m a totally different player and character to when England picked me. I’m two years older and have another 50-odd Premiership games in me. I still feel I haven’t reached my ceiling yet.”', 'The 26-year-old takes his place in a pack which is, otherwise, exactly the same as the one which kicked off the World Cup final in Yokohama 12 months ago. Billy Vunipola has not played for England since and will be mighty keen to reassert himself while Tom Curry and Sam Underhill now have the fast-rising Jack Willis on their heels.', 'Kyle Sinckler and Mako Vunipola, likewise, occupy positions in which there is now fierce competition. Youngs will hog the headlines as he prepares to become just the second English player after Jason Leonard to reach three figures but as England await the final title push it is their forwards who will shape their destiny.']","Six Nations 2020","Sport","2020-10-29",17.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c6fc0eb408267a19e5e8b39e8d29af19240c8c5/0_96_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e28d25e894b55b45c907c3268f4d68d9","Sam Simmonds scores a try during England’s last visit to Rome in 2018.

Three teams were also challenging for the title on the final day five years ago and Ireland pipped England after France scored five tries and 35 points at Twickenham in a crazy finale.', '“Attack and defence will be equally important,” said Mitchell. “The performance has to win the game and it is dangerous to get too focused on the scoreboard. We have to set the tone from the start and put ourselves in a position after 40 minutes. Then we can look to put the foot on the throat.”', 'England will be without the scrum-half Willi Heinz who sustained a soft tissue injury in training. Northampton’s uncapped Alex Mitchell was called into the squad, but it leaves Ben Youngs in line to start and become England’s second cap centurion, with Dan Robson on the bench.', 'The back row is likely to take up much of the selection meeting with Jack Willis, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola, Ben Earl, Lewis Ludlam and Ted Hill vying for the three starting positions.', '“We have depth and competition there,” Mitchell said. “Test rugby is different to the club game and it is about adapting to it, the ability to win collisions with and without the ball, its speed, repeated actions and less space. It is about adapting: some players have it in their skill set while others take a bit longer.”', 'Ireland will be the champions if they win with a bonus point at Stade de France, a ground where they have been restricted to kicks on their last two visits. They have made one change from the side who defeated Italy last weekend with Robbie Henshaw replacing the injured Garry Ringrose in the midfield.', 'The European Champions Cup winners Exeter have been drawn with Toulouse, the side they defeated in last month’s semi-final, and Glasgow, for the fourth time in the group stage, in next season’s tournament which starts in December, a week after the international programme concludes.

Scotland’s head coach, Gregor Townsend, was under pressure for the first time since taking over in 2017 and had dropped one of his talismen, the outside-half Finn Russell, for disciplinary reasons. But that was long ago and the systematic way they dismantled Wales’s threats on Saturday suggested a foundation has been laid.', 'Scotland profited from the lack of a crowd and the energy they drew from simple successes, such as winning a penalty at a scrum or breakdown and making a telling tackle, contrasted with the home side’s introspection. The 16-7 penalty count against Wales may not have been repeated had they been playing in front of their vocal supporters at the Principality Stadium, but in the past year they have been travelling in the opposite direction to Scotland. Their head coach, Wayne Pivac, now has some major decisions to make over players who served his predecessor, Warren Gatland, for all or most of the past decade.', '“There was a lot of thought and reflection from me and others after the World Cup,” said Townsend. “I felt we would be able to become more consistent given the players we have and the lessons we had learned. One of the things we had to change was being in positions to win matches as we went into the final 20 minutes.', '“I have big belief in this team and our long-term aim is to have a 30-35 strong squad where the quality on the bench is as good as that in the starting line-up. We have long had the ability to score 14 points in two minutes, but the control in the set-pieces has probably surpassed what I thought we could achieve this season.”', 'Scotland are grouped with France, Italy and Fiji in the Autumn Nations Cup and will have home advantage against Les Bleus, the fixture that should decide who finishes first. A problem for Townsend is that he faces being without Russell, who came off in the first-half of the 14-10 victory over Wales with a groin injury, and his replacement, Adam Hastings, who popped a shoulder. Hogg finished at 10 and kicked the final penalty to seal victory.', 'It said everything about Wales’s performance that in the final 10 minutes, when they trailed by a point, they put no pressure on Scotland, and the scoreline did not reflect the difference between the sides. Alun Wyn Jones broke the record for the number of international caps with 150, but at times appeared alone in his resistance. The autumn should be the time for Pivac to assess his options looking towards the next World Cup, but after five successive defeats he needs a result.', '“No one likes losing but everyone goes through a patch in their career when they don’t win,” said the Wales wing Josh Adams. “It is how we come together as a team. We cannot dwell on this result with a new competition coming up. When your back is up against the wall it is about how you react.”']","Six Nations 2020","Sport","2020-11-02",9.49,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c882019c7b03259f6ee203b7fcb3f3ee25622/187_124_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=98699949de2b49d048a76911d3c67b29","Scotland’s Stuart Hogg, whose kick made sure of victory against Wales, celebrates winning a penalty at Parc y Scarlets.

  ["Serena Williams battles burden of expectation before Simona Halep final","['Both Wimbledon finalists will be fighting their emotions in what should be a momentous duel, with the American well placed for a 24th slam']","['When Sabine Lisicki lost the final at Wimbledon to Marion Bartoli in 2013, she could not control the flow of tears that showed her desolation. Within 41 days Bartoli had retired, at only 28, after losing to Simona Halep in Cincinnati, unable to stand the aggregated pain of a long career, becoming the first Wimbledon champion not to defend her title since the 1969 winner, Ann Jones.', 'The antagonists in the final six years ago handled the aftermath in their own ways. Bartoli contemplated a comeback, thought better of it and found a home in the commentary box, while “Boom Boom” Lisicki, the fastest server in the game between 2014 and 2016 at 130mph, never quite got back the magic. At the Australian Open this year, and only 29, she went out in the first round of qualifying, for the third time on the spin at a slam.', 'This is a deceptively tough sport, as the finalists on Saturday know too well. Halep began to flower in the years that followed her defeat of Bartoli, to the point where she won the French Open last year and has reigned as No 1 in the world; Williams’s story is familiar to all, a tale of alternating glory and struggle that would seem to have at least a chapter or two left.', 'What they both share is a lingering fight with their emotions. Until Halep calmed her outer shell over the past couple of years, she was among the most volatile of competitors on the WTA Tour. Williams, as she admitted on Thursday after her best performance of the tournament – a 59-minute demolition of Barbora Strycova – cannot be sure from day to day how she will handle the pressures and expectations of her calling, even though she is by overwhelming consensus the finest player of her era.', 'Privately, she would agree with that. Good manners prevent her from saying so in public – and that brings its own baggage. When Williams was in place to record a calendar slam in the latter stages of the 2015 US Open, her emotions ran wild and she collapsed in a lachrymose cloud not dissimilar to the one that enveloped Lisicki, losing in the semi-finals to the Italian doubles artist Roberta Vinci.', 'And last September, again the red mist came down across her furious and disbelieving eyes as she railed against the perceived injustice heaped on her by the chair umpire Carlos Ramos and lost in the most theatrical exit. This week, in an article in Harper’s Bazaar, she reached out to her Flushing Meadows conqueror, Naomi Osaka, in a reprise of her case against Ramos, blaming the media for the furore.', 'Now she is returned to another statistical hell – or heaven, if she wins: victory on Saturday would give Williams her eighth Wimbledon singles title and her 24th major, matching the Australian Margaret Court for the most slams in the history of the sport. That is some achievement – yet Williams again is trying to downplay its significance, just as she did ahead of her match against Vinci four years ago.', 'She alternates between handling the responsibilities and rewards of greatness and being consumed by them. She should be comforted, though, by the evidence of her progress to the final, which contained only one glaring blip, when she fell over the line in three sets against Alison Riske. Her return to form in the semi-finals against Strycova was astonishing.', 'It could come down to a factor as obvious as the serve – and Serena, predictably, has a considerable edge here. No one in the draw has hit more than her 45 aces but, for someone who red-lines her power at around 120mph, she has logged surprisingly few double-faults: 11, in fact, which is a risk-reward ratio of about four to one.', 'Halep, however, is tied for 26 on the list with a clutch of others who have fallen, including Coco Gauff, who went out in the fourth round, and Belinda Bencic, a round earlier. But her risk-reward return is way poorer than Williams’s: nine aces, 12 double-faults.', 'The Romanian is no slouch with racket in hand, of course, but her fastest serve of the fortnight is 110mph – fully 12 miles an hour slower than the booming deliveries of her opponent.', 'Once that ball is in play, the return is vital and, if it is to be of any quality coming back at the American, Halep has to be brave, taking it on the rise occasionally, or making sure she delivers a heavy and precise enough blow from deep to keep the exchange alive. Only then is parity possible.', 'She is 15th on the tournament leaderboard for getting her return back, with 83%, and that is healthy. And here is the shock of the numbers: Williams lies tied for 66th in returns with 283 from 383, or 74%. That is exactly a hundred balls she has failed to get back in play when receiving and Halep will have taken that into account, no doubt.', 'After all that, it will be a surprise – not on the scale of her defeat by Vinci in New York – if Williams does not stand in the middle of Centre Court as the freshly crowned queen of Wimbledon, and the game itself.']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-12",16.33,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d98c8ed84224c56ba1670ff404351b6f2cb76b/0_99_1479_887/master/1479.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d17a0cd1392db579eb7046fe6b1cb86d","Serena Williams can switch between handling the responsibilities of greatness and being consumed by them.

Here there was sharpness at the net and confidence in moving to the volley that bore the signs of her mixed doubles campaign with Murray, and she will need all of that and more to beat Simona Halep in the final on Saturday.', 'As she put it after beating Strycova 6-1, 6-2 in 59 minutes: “I promise you, when I hit a volley I was like: ‘Would I have made that if I didn’t play doubles?’ I don’t think so. I kept telling you guys I thought the doubles would help me. I really think it did. I don’t attack the net that much. I tried to and I want to.', '“I know when I do, when I play doubles here with Venus, it definitely helps my singles game. I was really keen to play mixed here. I feel like it helped me, not just for today and this event but hopefully it will help me in the future.”', 'So, there is hope for Murray still to have another tilt at one of the game’s lesser titles, but one that plainly helped Williams on day 10. Tracy Austin, who won the mixed doubles title here in 1980, thinks so.', '“Playing mixed doubles with Andy Murray brought her intensity up,” the former world No 1 said in conversation with the BBC’s Sue Barker, “because we know how intense Andy is.”', 'Martina Navratilova observed of Williams’s win against the 33-year-old Czech: “Strycova was on the run every single shot. She defended to win her three games but that is all she had.”', 'Williams’s serve clicked near its best, delivering her the point 24 times out of 27 at the first attempt, nine from 17 when she needed a second serve, and striking 28 clear winners in such a short match, demonstrating how commanding she was.', 'Whether or not she can reproduce that brilliance against Halep, who beat the No 8 seed Elina Svitolina almost as impressively – 6-1, 6-3 in 1hr 13min – might depend on the American’s mood. As Williams admitted when reflecting on her relaxed demeanour: “I was calm today. It’s a day-to-day basis with me. We all know that. I’m far from perfect.”', 'That is patently true. It is 10 months since she lost all sense of proportion and discipline in losing the US Open final, although she insisted in an open letter this week to her conqueror, Naomi Osaka, that it was the media’s fault.', 'Ther was no friction here, though. All was well in the world and her smile was wide and generous. She revealed she had been thinking that morning about her journey, about motherhood, her post-match outfit, her first Wimbledon final, against her sister Venus in 2002, and about the number 24, the next hurdle to jump. Or did she?', '“I thought about it this morning,” she began, adding quickly: “I actually didn’t think about it, because it’s really not about 24 or 23 or 25. It’s just about going out there and giving my best effort, no matter what. No matter what I do, I will always have a great career. I don’t know … I just kind of let it go this morning. Yeah, I feel really calm about it.” Maybe she does.', 'Strycova, who looked in the form of her life defeating Johanna Konta on Tuesday, was philosophical, too, in defeat, full of admiration for the player Murray calls “one of the greatest of all time”. Strycova said: “I think it was her best match of all here. She was serving amazing. She was playing very deep, so I really couldn’t play the way I wanted to do.', '“If she will play like this in the final, it’s going to be very hard for Simona. But Simona has also her weapons.

  ["Wimbledon 2019: Halep ‘desperate’ for title after semi-final win over Svitolina","[' Former world No 1 attributes victory to new confidence on grass']","['Simona Halep has an air of contentment about her that should make anyone expecting another Serena Williams procession on Saturday think twice. Her mantra all season has been simple – “I just want to chill” – but behind her relaxed demeanour is the quiet confidence of a former world No 1 who knows she is at the top of her game.', 'After a cagey start to her semi-final victory over Elina Svitolina – the first two games took 20 minutes – Halep was far too strong for the Ukrainian eighth seed and she needed only another 43 minutes to seal a place in her first ever Wimbledon final. And considering she has already dumped out the 15-year-old breakout star Coco Gauff in the fourth round it would be naive to expect that a Centre Court crowd hoping to see Williams claim a historic 24th grand slam title will knock her out of her stride.', '“I’m desperate to win Wimbledon more than to stop her,” said Halep, the 2018 French Open champion. “I’m not thinking about her record. It’s a great feeling to face Serena in a grand slam final. If you are able to win, it makes it sweeter. If you lose, then you have to look forward for the next one. I have no pressure on myself, just a positive one. I have expectations for myself that I can do a great job. Still, I’m chilled.”', 'To watch Halep on court, “chilled” would not be the first word that springs to mind – she is certainly prone to the odd furious outburst – but off it she seems full of bonhomie. Inevitably she faced plenty of questions at the prospect of another clash with Williams, who knocked her out of this year’s Australian Open in three sets, but she covered an array of topics in her post-match press conference, ranging from why the British snooker player Mark Selby is one of just two people she follows on Twitter to why “the air from the beach” means Romania’s current crop all seem to be emerging from her home town of Constanta. “I have no idea how you play snooker but I appreciate [Mark]. He’s been in Romania a few times. I met him and also I have a snooker ball signed from him.”', 'Ultimately it becomes clear that a key reason for Halep’s laid-back approach to Wimbledon this year is that she finally feels comfortable on grass. That has not always been the case – even though she reached the 2014 semi-finals when an ankle injury hindered her chances of reaching the final – but this time she feels the penny has finally dropped.', '“This week I realised that I have a good chance on grass because I have strong legs, I can open the court,” she added. “The court works for me if I play the right tactic. When the ball is coming to me, now I know what to do with it. Maybe that’s why. Maybe I feel confident and I’m not scared any more of how the ball bounces.”', 'Working with a psychologist for the last two years has clearly helped too. “I started to learn how to keep the things simple because I overcomplicated everything in my head. I was thinking too much,” she said. “Sometimes I had too many options how to play and I didn’t pick the right one in the right moment.”', 'Throughout her march to the final Halep’s return of serve has stood out and Svitolina’s spirit was broken in those first two gruelling games, both won by Halep. The Ukrainian has been struggling with a knee injury this season which only added to the sense of inevitability once Halep had seized the initiative – so much so that Svitolina failed to hold serve in the opening set.', 'That Halep conceded only one point on her serve in the second set will give her confidence before facing Williams. She will also be buoyed by realising her mother’s dream in reaching the Wimbledon final here, admitting that she hopes Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, is among those in the Royal Box.', '“I talked to my mum after the match,” added Halep. “About 10 or 15 years ago she said her dream is [for me] to play the final at Wimbledon. She said I think it’s an unbelievable moment. So today her dream came true.”']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-11",14.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7912e883285dad7be312fddb5f764e137d00e221/0_155_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ba2111405b900e6e716ad5939213069a","Simona Halep is into her first Wimbledon final after victory over Elina Svitolina.

Throughout his 14-year professional career he has defied the odds and all expert opinion. He has invariably found a way.', 'None of his serial physical blows seemed to have killed his love of the game, although he came perilously close to walking away after his hip pain kicked in brutally in the first round of the Australian Open in January. One final operation saved his career.', 'It could hardly have been clearer from his demeanour on Centre Court on Saturday evening, when he and Williams laughed and smiled their way through an easy opening match, that he is convinced he made the right decision in carrying on.', 'The next challenge is to break out from the relatively undemanding world of doubles, in the men’s and mixed, to test himself in singles again. That could happen in Cincinnati in September as a dress rehearsal for a full return to the heat of competition at the US Open, where he won his first slam title seven years ago.', 'Much has happened since 2012 across the Tour as the rivals he grew up with have won their own struggles against injury and the ravages of time but Murray insists he can work his way back into that picture. “I know how bad I felt in Australia and how bad I felt the last year that I played singles here, and I feel better now than I did then,” he says.', 'His last singles appearance at Wimbledon, when he hobbled through five sets against Sam Querrey in 2017, mirrored the trauma of the Roberto Bautista Agut match in Melbourne but, as far as Murray is concerned, those experiences have been parked in the past. He has survived them and learned from the consequences.', '“If, physically, I can get back to a good level my tennis is still fine,” he says. “I’m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up with guys. I don’t feel that the game has moved on and I won’t be able to get back. A lot of the same guys are still there.”', 'It has been starkly illustrated in the first week here that the expected rise of the young contenders in the men’s game is still in its early stages, as, one by one, they have fallen. The sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, went out in the first round along with the seventh, Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by the Canadian teenager Félix Auger-Aliassime in the third round.', 'A slew of prospects and established seeds have failed to reach the second week. From one side of the draw alone Kevin Anderson, last year’s finalist and the fourth seed, has gone, along with the three-slam champion Stan Wawrinka, 10th seed Karen Khachanov, 11th seed Daniil Medvedev, as well as Britain’s Kyle Edmund. Gone also, after a fighting exit on Saturday night, is back-in-form Dan Evans.', 'On the other side of the draw notable casualties include Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner, Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Alex de Minaur. Still standing, of course, are Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, along with Kei Nishikori, the only top-10 players left.', 'Murray, meanwhile, is determined to play his one remaining card for as long as he can, having lost in the first round of the men’s doubles earlier on Saturday. But did he not miss the cut and thrust of high-grade singles, though? Yes and no.', '“It’s just different, singles and doubles. There is a lot more self-analysis in singles. It’s your responsibility. The thing that is nice with doubles is that, when you win, you are winning with someone else and that is enjoyable.', '“When me and Feli [López] won at Queen’s, we went out and bonded with each other, had dinner and that sort of stuff. In singles at the end of matches it is on you and that is the thing I’ve always had that is kind of different to doubles really.', '“At Queen’s, for example, we won the end of that final because of Feli. He played brilliant at the end of the match. So it is difficult to know how responsible you were for certain things. That’s the thing that is different about it that I am not used to as much.”', 'For all that he is enjoying his mixed doubles experiment with Williams, there is a murmur beneath that strongly suggests he cannot wait to get back to being a champion again – on his own.']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-07",22.3,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c708c9ac871fe100524409afd57418e4f01f3de8/439_210_2787_1672/master/2787.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8e41ed26e5bac60a42cb42dcb0fd21b7","Andy Murray is enjoying life on court again as a doubles player but is eyeing a return to singles.

Centre Court is an unfortunate setting for a bad day at the office and there was nowhere for the former world No 1 to hide when the wheels fell off, leaving her bemused audience to wonder if it was kinder to look away and let her suffer in private.', 'Rarely can Azarenka have experienced such a dramatic collapse. All Simona Halep had to do was wait for the former Australian Open champion to miss. And, boy, did she miss a lot, three double-faults and 33 unforced errors the tale of a 6-3, 6-1 defeat by Halep, who cannot have imagined her progress into the fourth round of Wimbledon would be so straightforward.', 'Remarkably Azarenka made the faster start, attacking the seventh seed’s serve to lead 3-1, but the world No 40 proceeded to lose 11 of the next 12 games and her low mood was summed up by the moment when she received a code violation for racket abuse at the end of the first set.', 'With Halep shifting uncomfortably up the other end, Azarenka stirred momentarily at the start of the second set. The ailing Belarusian toughed out a service game and soon earned a break point. But Halep saved it and the Romanian cruised to a focused victory.', 'Karolina Pliskova was happy to pass a tricky examination against the dizzyingly unusual game of Hsieh Su-wei, a player who struggles to find hitting partners because of her penchant for unorthodoxy. “You want to play normal tennis and not this tennis in practice,” Pliskova said earlier this week – and it was difficult to know if theNo 3 seed was complimenting Hsieh or aiming snark her way.', 'Whatever Pliskova’s intentions, her comment certainly added some edge to the opener on Centre Court. If nobody enjoys taking on Hsieh, it is because the 33-year-old from Chinese Taipei has worked to hone her style and is capable of executing it to cutting effect. At 5ft 7in she has to find ways of making the tour’s giants unsteady on their feet and she does so by throwing her opponents off with improvised guile, endless chopped slices and even the odd two-handed forehand. The combination is bewitching when it comes together.', 'This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.', 'Yet while Hsieh is an expert safe-cracker, the rangy Pliskova’s method of banging down doors with heavy groundstrokes and big serves tends to elicit greater rewards. Pliskova, triumphant at Eastbourne last week, should have a better record at SW19 – the former world No 1 has never made it past the fourth round – and she eventually sussed Hsieh out before winning 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.', '“She can make you feel ugly,” Pliskova said. “It’s tough to prepare because sometimes I don’t think she even knows what she’s going to play. You have to be ready for everything.”', 'Pliskova next plays another Czech after Karolina Muchova, the world No 68, used her variety to secure a polished 7-6 (7), 6-3 victory over Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit, the 20th seed.', 'There were strange scenes during Zhang Shuai’s surprising 6-4, 6-2 win over Caroline Wozniacki, who appeared to blame HawkEye for several lost points during her defeat by her unseeded Chinese opponent. “How are we playing with HawkEye that is this bad?” the 14th seed asked the umpire during the second set. “This is not fair. It’s so ridiculous. This is absurd. That one was far out, this one was maybe close, but it’s out. It’s crazy. Obviously it’s wrongly put.”', 'The umpire appeared to sympathise with the Dane when he said: “I understand your point but there is nothing I can do. We have to go with that.”', 'Wozniacki, who lost her way after squandering a 4-0 lead in the first set and an early break in the second, was somewhat more diplomatic after the match. “I thought there were a few ones that I saw way differently,” said the 28-year-old. “But it is what it is. You can’t really change a HawkEye call. Maybe it was right. I just saw it differently. But you trust HawkEye normally. You trust that it tells you the right thing.', '“Sometimes you do see the balls a little differently than what the HawkEye is. At least you know you can get it out of your mind.

The mixed doubles draw had landed. And there it was, confirmation of a historic partnership: Andy Murray, feminist and all-round good guy, to play with Serena Williams, the American he calls “one of the best tennis players of all time”.', 'This once-in-a-lifetime show will, the All England Club hope, run for longer than their first-round match against Germany’s Andreas Mies and the American-born Chilean Alexa Guarachi. “Alexa? What are the odds of Murray and Williams reaching the second week?” “I’m sorry. I don’t understand the question.”', 'The first part of the question was not answered until late on Tuesday, about 15 hours before the entry deadline, when Murray and Williams stopped teasing everyone and announced they were an item. His courting of the women’s Tour was looking forlorn until then, as texts and phone calls crisscrossed the strange Tinder world of doubles, where relationships can last as long as cream on a strawberry.', 'As is his nature, Murray agonised over his commitment to both forms of doubles as if he were picking a birthday present for his mother. He said after practice on Wednesday: “We chatted about it for a couple of days. I know she had had problems with her knee this year and both sides wanted to see how her match [against Giulia Gatto-Monticone] went before we did the final part. She felt fine [serving up to 125mph] and I saw her briefly today. She seems like she is up for it.', '“With everything that has gone on the last couple of years, you don’t know what’s coming next. The opportunity to play with Serena, one of the best tennis players of all time and one of the greatest female athletes ever – it’s something that I may never get another chance to do. And I might not play mixed doubles again so, if I’m going to do it once, the chance to play with her is brilliant.”', 'Murray earlier in the week talked about how the grand slam tournaments could boost doubles – both versions – by cutting matches to three sets and revive the profile it had in the days when John McEnroe was a regular with Peter Fleming, when the singles stars regularly tried their hand at a two-hander.', '“It [would] be a positive thing for tennis if more guys were playing doubles,” he said. “But here it’s difficult because of the format, the best-of-five sets. I would never expect a top singles player to enter the doubles here because playing potentially 10 sets in one day is just too much. That’s something that would be worth looking at, to give more value to the doubles event, to get more of the top singles players playing, reduce the length of the matches.”', 'That went down like lukewarm punch with Richard Lewis, chief executive of the All England Club, but he is a forward-thinker always open to persuasion – especially if the best player in the nation’s history is talking.', 'There has not been this much interest in mixed doubles at Wimbledon since Murray’s elder brother, Jamie, broke through for the family at the highest level in 2007, when he and Jelena Janković won the title. Actually, his second win in the discipline, with Martina Hingis two years ago –when they beat Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen in the final – probably matched it.', 'Jamie and Serena’s compatriot, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, are in the bottom half of the draw.

But, if he is to further confound the doubters and lift another Wimbledon title, his 101st win at the All England Club will have to be his 16th against Rafael Nadal when they meet in the semi-finals on Friday in their 40th contest. That will be an altogether different proposition.', '“We have a lot of information on Rafa and so does he on us,” Federer said. “You can dive into all that stuff or say this is grasscourt tennis and just attack. It was a joy to play against Rafa at Roland Garros [where Nadal won their semi-final in straight sets on his favoured clay]. I go about it like every other match.”', 'Nadal, who has won here twice (including their memorable 2008 final), has fallen in love with the Wimbledon grass again after years of poor results.

On Wednesday, he beat Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.', 'Whoever wins that semi-final will almost certainly face Djokovic, who was awesome again in thrashing poor David Goffin in three quick sets earlier in the day. Barring the Serb’s way to the final is the 23rd seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, who has beaten him twice this year, on hardcourts in Miami and Doha, so he is dangerous. But Djokovic will start a prohibitive favourite in that match.', 'So here they are again, the Big Three, gathered around the biggest prize in the game. In the fourth round, they gave up just 19 games between them; on Wednesday, the total rose to 30. But they are peerless. For all the talk that they were about to bow to youth at these championships they continue to set the standard, a remarkable dominance.', 'Nevertheless, only once have they all gone into the Wimbledon semi‑finals together, in 2007, when Nadal defeated Djokovic and then lost against Federer in the final. Federer is the oldest at 37 and there were fleeting moments at the beginning of his match when he looked it.', 'When Nishikori – appearing in his fifth grand slam quarter‑final in succession – nailed the first set after 40 minutes the hush in the seats told the story: their hero was struggling.', 'Of course, they kept the faith and the backlash in the second set was swift – for the loss of a single game in 22 minutes – but the grind resumed before Federer got it done in two hours and 36 minutes.', '“It was difficult,” Federer admitted courtside. “The beginning was brutal. Kei came out and was smashing winners; he was the better player. So it was important to get the lead and protect it, then start a normal match at one set all. I served really good and protected that until the very end.”', 'As for his century of Wimbledon victories, he said: “You’re not thinking hundred, hundred. A fan told me. It was a sweet way to do it. The crowd were so nice.”', 'They are never less than nice. Their love for Federer is boundless. And he appreciates it more than people realise. In an interesting aside later, the Swiss was asked how much time he spends alone.', '“Not much,” Federer said, pausing. “I don’t like being alone. I mean, I’m not afraid of being alone. I like being surrounded by my friends, family. It’s obviously the best. I like talking to people. Now, with four kids anyway, there is a lot of that, which is perfect for me in my life because I’m very happy.”']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-10",20.18,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1dd04f351813a05464cde3d8ce368f14a0475e/0_13_5016_3011/master/5016.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ab82bc82d7b6fad35a5c87c1680033b0","Roger Federer recovered from dropping the first set to beat Kei Nishikori comfortably in their quarter-final.

  ["Lewis Hamilton closes on Schumacher's record after winning Belgian Grand Prix","['Mercedes driver leads every lap from pole position to win race', 'Valtteri Bottas second and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen third']","['If the challenge of the glorious 19 corners and sweeping high-speed elevation changes of the Spa‑Francorchamps circuit are beloved by fans and drivers alike, Lewis Hamilton tamed them almost to the point of mundanity in winning the Belgian Grand Prix.', 'The world champion’s victory was another masterclass in dominant control and flawless execution, operating on a level rapidly suggesting this season at least he is untouchable. Spa is a classic track, a drivers’ circuit testing bravery and judgment. Hamilton made it look easy.', 'He was unchallenged throughout, leading and dictating the race with relentless efficiency from pole. His Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas was second but never threatened, while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was the only driver to stay with the two leaders and took third.', 'Ferrari’s difficult season reached a low point with Sebastian Vettel finishing 13th and Charles Leclerc 14th. The Scuderia were left flailing in the forests of the Ardennes and face intense pressure going into what amounts to two home grands prix in two weeks at Monza and Mugello. The absence of massed ranks of the tifosi may turn out to be a blessing.', 'Hamilton, however, had been in consummate control from the off. So much so that he was largely in a race of his own. Indeed he felt almost apologetic afterwards as he returned his fifth win of the season. The similarity to his authoritative victory in Spain at the last round was notable. Hamilton conceded the level at which he and his team are operating is making these races seem almost as series of fait accompli.', '“I know it is not what everyone wants to see, a Mercedes at the front,” Hamilton said. “But no matter how much success we have we just keep our heads down. Back at the office, there are no guys celebrating. It is all about how we can win the next race.”', 'Verstappen, once more unable to challenge for the lead but a country mile clear of the rest of the pack, had another lonely race in third and gave a blunt assessment of how the pecking order in F1 pans out on one of the greatest race tracks in the world. “It was pretty boring. Not much to do. I couldn’t keep up with them when they started pushing,” he said. “It was not really enjoyable out there today. It was a bit lonely.”', 'Part of the issue here is Mercedes have emerged this season with a car and engine combination that has once again given them a definitive edge over their rivals. But in Hamilton’s hands it is proving to be a devastating weapon that is setting him apart. He was half a second clear of Bottas in qualifying, bringing a finesse to the single lap that is proving unmatchable. Then in race pace he has too much for his nearest rival, his teammate in the same machinery.', 'The Finn has few chances and in Spa he had two and could not capitalise on either. Verstappen in turn is extracting the maximum but Red Bull are yet to close to the pace of that Mercedes out front. The world champion does not chase numbers but he has them adding up this season like never before. His 89th career win and his fourth at Spa, ended the run of recent Ferrari victories at the circuit and put him in touching distance of Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 wins, a tally he could equal at Mugello in two weeks’ time. He is also well on course to match Schumacher’s record of seven championships, enjoying a very comfortable advantage in the title race, leading the championship with 157 points, in front of Verstappen on 110 and Bottas on 107.', '', '1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 157pts2 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1103 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 1074 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 485 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 456 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 457 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 428 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 339 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 3310 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Renault 2611 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 2312 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia AlphaTauri 1813 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1614 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Racing Point 615 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing 216 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia AlphaTauri\\xa017 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 118 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 019 Nicholas Latifi (Can) Williams 020 George Russell (Gbr) Williams 021 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas F1 0', '', 'For Ferrari, who won the last two races here in Spa with dominant victories delivered through their straightline speed advantage, the meeting has been a traumatic, sobering experience. Their engine is down on power after the FIA clarified specific engine regulations to Ferrari late last season and they feared being under the cosh in Spa with their power deficit and so it proved. Way down from the leaders in practice, and struggling in the first and third sectors, they lack speed, and struggled with making the tyres work leading to a lack of grip. After qualifying in 13th and 14th, the race offered no respite, nor improvement in positions. Leclerc won here last year but this time they faced no little ignominy in Vettel being easily passed by the customer Ferrari-engined Alfa Romeo of Kimi Raikkonen for a place outside even the points.', 'At the sharp end it was a different story. Hamilton made a clean start into La Source and held off Bottas on the run through Eau Rouge, any chance the Finn had of mugging his teammate on the opening lap had gone by the time they emerged on to the Kemmel straight. With Hamilton having opened a familiar gap Bottas’s only other chance came after the restart caused by a safety car after Antonio Giovinazzi had a major accident taking out George Russell. Neither was harmed but when racing resumed once again Hamilton held his lead and the clean air out front.', 'It was unspectacular as he conceded but he is performing in perfect harmony with what is proving to be a relentlessly efficient tool. Hamilton’s sights are set on another title, nothing at Spa suggested he can be diverted from securing it sooner rather than later.', 'Daniel Ricciardo was fourth for Renault and his teammate Esteban Ocon in fifth.

  ["South African teams eclipse Australia's Super Rugby efforts","['Form so far this season indicates a competitive Springboks team could be assembled by just selecting players from domestic franchises']","['There have been reports South Africa will leave Sanzaar after the 2023 World Cup to play in an expanded Six Nations tournament – but perhaps the Springboks can have the best of both worlds. The country is committed to Sanzaar until 2025, but that arrangement does not necessarily need to be a barrier to its northern ambitions. ', 'South Africa is uniquely placed as a southern hemisphere superpower which lies in the European timezone, which means the Springboks have the potential to play in both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship. ', 'That might sound fanciful, but consider this: in the early 1990s the Lithuanian basketball team toured Australia to play a series of games against the Boomers. At the same time Lithuania played in an international tournament in Europe. How did the Lithuanians achieve this seemingly impossible task? They simply selected two different teams.', 'South Africa is in a position to do likewise with the Springboks. They already have a footprint in Europe with the Cheetahs and Southern Kings – re-located from Super Rugby when the competition was reduced from 18 teams to 15 in 2018 – playing in the Guinness PRO 14. Many of South Africa’s 2019 World Cup-winning Springboks are playing for English and French clubs too.', 'This means South Africa possesses a pool of talent in Europe to draw on to select a competitive Springboks team to play in the Six Nations. Similarly, they would be capable of assembling another competitive Springboks team from its Super Rugby franchises to play in the Rugby Championship.', 'The South Africans could field similar teams in the July and November Test windows, while a re-unified Springboks team could play at the World Cup.', 'There have only been two rounds of Super Rugby this season, but indications are South Africa could put together a very good Springboks team by just selecting players from its domestic franchises. ', 'So far South African teams have won three of the four Super Rugby games they have played against non-South African opposition. The Stormers beat the Hurricanes 27-0 in Cape Town; the Sharks defeated the Highlanders 42-20 in Dunedin; and the Lions downed the Reds 27-20 in Johannesburg.', 'This compares favourably with the efforts of the Australian teams who failed to beat any non-Australian opposition in the first two rounds. Apart from the Reds losing to the Lions, the Melbourne Rebels were upset 36-27 by the Sunwolves in Fukuoka, while the NSW Waratahs lost to the Crusaders 43-25 in Nelson and to the Blues 32-12 in Newcastle.', 'It is early days, of course, but if this trend continues the consequences for Australian rugby – on and off the field – could be dire. It was only a few years ago, in the 2017 Super Rugby season, that no Australian team won any games against New Zealand opposition. The way things are looking at the moment most of the Australian teams will struggle to win any games against either New Zealand or South African sides.', 'The Brumbies are the only Australian team to have won any games at all so far with both of their wins against the Reds (27-24) and Rebels (39-26) coming at the expense of fellow Australian sides. While the Brumbies are only one of four teams to remain undefeated after the first two rounds, their real test will come when they play the Highlanders in Canberra on Friday night.', 'The well-drilled Brumbies may not be at the same level as the Crusaders or the Chiefs, but they should be able to compete with the other New Zealand and South African teams. If they are to do so, they will need to improve their defence, having missed 21 tackles against the Rebels.', 'What about the other Australian teams? Will they beat any New Zealand or South African opposition this season? Or the Jaguares or Sunwolves for that matter? The Reds have been competitive in their two losses to the Brumbies and the Lions, they just do not seem to know how to win.', 'But the Waratahs and the Rebels have been plain awful. The Waratahs attracted their lowest ever crowd – 7,491 – when they lost to a depleted Blues team which had 10 players unavailable, including All Blacks backs Beauden Barrett and Rieko Ioane. It was a wet night in Newcastle, but the Waratahs need to start winning or their long-suffering fans will continue to abandon them. Likewise, the Rebels.', 'At least one of these under-performing teams will notch a win when they play each other in Melbourne on Friday night – unless it is a draw.

  ["Getafe tear Valencia apart and rip up the cliches as they climb ever higher","['José Bordalás’s side are third after beating a far wealthier rival for a European place to a pulp. What they are doing is absurd']","['“Mission accomplished,” José Bordalás said. It was six o’clock on Saturday 8 February and Getafe’s manager reckoned they had reached their target. “Not mathematically,” he conceded, sitting there at the Coliseum where another team had been thrown to the lions, “but virtually.” Outside, 13,070 supporters had spent the afternoon serenading him, singing “Bordalás, I love you” as Getafe beat Valencia, the club whose centre forward cost twice as much as their entire starting XI. And no wonder: two goals from Jorge Molina and one from Jaime Mata took them to 42 points, securing another season in primera for the team he took over in the relegation zone, second bottom.', 'Of segunda.', 'Up from the second, into the first, staying there twice and safe again with 15 matches still to go, time for some other target then. They won’t say so, not publicly at least, but it’s not just the league Getafe aspire to be in next season; it’s the Champions League too. And while they have been here before – last year, they missed out on the final day, 22 minutes of which they spent in fourth – this time they’re even better placed than before. More importantly, it’s still absurd. Just doing what they did to Valencia is pretty silly.', 'Valencia-Getafe is a very modern rivalry and a startlingly bitter one too, built on recriminations, emerging swiftly and embraced deeply. There has been fighting talk and actual fighting. Last season’s Copa del Rey tie, won in the last minute by Valencia, turned into full-on battle where there genuinely was blood, sweat and tears, and when Getafe lost that last Champions League place it was to Valencia. Yet Bordalás insisted that didn’t make Saturday’s win taste better – although for the fans it probably did – and nor is that why Valencia manager Albert Celades referred to Getafe as “direct rivals”. Instead, it was because this was third against fifth, two points apart, making it a match of huge significance. “We’re competing for the same thing,” Celades said.', 'They shouldn’t be. Valencia’s salary cap, set by the league (the total amount they are allowed to spend on their playing staff, transfers and wages included), is €170m. Getafe’s is €56m. Eleven teams have a bigger budget; Barcelona and Madrid’s annual revenue is 16 times theirs. The 14 men who played on Saturday cost €16.2m. Maxi López cost €30m. So did Rodrigo Moreno. Getafe’s most expensive player is Nemanja Maksimovic, who Valencia didn’t want. In the winter window they lost their first-choice centre-back to bottom-placed Espanyol, for goodness sake.', '“I tell my players that they should believe, that they should set their own limits, not let anyone else do that for them; I try to get them to see that they have talent, that they can do it, tell them that players at big clubs are no better than them,” Bordalás said. But they’re supposed to be.', 'Getafe’s real, original rivalry is with Leganés, built on gravel pitches in regional football to the south of Madrid and somehow established in primera. Coming up to 38, officially the captain is older than the club he plays for: when Molina signed, at 34, seemingly on the way down, he thought he’d never reach the first division again. His strike partner, Mata, scoring goals as a student but never really seeing this as a career, didn’t think he would ever get there at all. The other striker, Ángel, was 30 when he signed, unexpectedly getting the chance to go back. The year before Damián Suárez joined, he was relegated with Elche and in his first year at Getafe was relegated again. When Xabi Exteita signed this summer, it was from relegation with Huesca. Allan Nyom had just gone down with West Brom. And on it goes: 28 relegations the squad have endured between them.', 'And yet on Saturday – on any given Sunday, in fact – Bordalás was right. They are no worse than players at bigger clubs. In fact, they are better. In the case of Valencia, miles better. At the end of Saturday’s game, standing at the touchline having been beaten, it took Valencia defender Gabriel five or six seconds to say anything, the silence deafening, a lost look in his eyes, like a broken man. “I can’t say anything …” he eventually mumbled, trying to bite his tongue. When at last he did, he said: “It was shit, all of it. Everything was shit.” Which was true, but that’s what Getafe do to a lot of teams.', 'Besides, if everything Valencia did was shit, everything Getafe did was brilliant. They didn’t just defeat Valencia, they took them to pieces; in doing so, they took the cliches to pieces too.', 'It finished 3-0. It could have been four, five, six or more. “Bish, bash, bosh” read the headline in AS, which summed it up quite nicely, Valencia beaten to a pulp, except it was more subtle than that. “Boring,” “dirty,” defensive Getafe, the “anti-football” team who actually spend more time in the opposition half than anyone else in Spain, had 22 shots. They had 10 on target and nine corners. Valencia didn’t have any of either. They had more of the ball, more passes, more crosses, more dribbles, more everything except fouls. They’re tough it’s true, and at times maybe it isn’t easy on the eye, skilled at the “other football”, but they can play, like Bordalás says. Last week at Athletic, Damián Suárez turned all Leo Messi. This week, Molina turned all Denis Bergkamp. Turned all the Valencia defence too, leaving them in a cartoon knot, knees facing backwards, legs wrapped round each other.', 'Molina’s second goal was superb, “a work of art” Bordalás said, a mess of Valencia defenders sent out for cigarettes: a shift one way, yoo-hoo, bye, a shift the other, and it was in the net. But it wasn’t about that; it was about everything. It was that while the first dropped to him from a rebound, he had made the opportunity in the first place, the third he had made in five minutes; that while it might have been a potty-mouthed guiri, or foreigner, who called him “so fucking good” on the radio, far from reproach the line, the presenter repeated it. Molina stops the clock, master of time and space, magically appearing around him. Hold, wait, apply the pause and then the pass, something from nothing. There is no better slow-motion dribbler, defenders lulled then defeated, so smooth, almost silent, no better way out.', '“He’s like El Cid, everyone follows him,” Bordalás said, making Molina blush. “The feeling is reciprocated,” Molina said, smiling softly. Everything is and it is all of them. Just look at the forwards: Molina has been wonderful; Mata got a Spain call-up; this week, the talk in Getafe was that Barcelona were coming for Ángel. Cucurella, Arambarri, Maksimovic, Djené, Soria and stop there … it wouldn’t be fair to keep going and leave anyone out.', 'Bordalás certainly won’t. He was quick to highlight Ángel’s role in the third. Getafe’s top scorer on nine goals, eight of them off the bench, Ángel had the chance to get another but instead rolled it across for Mata to score. There was something in that, a portrait of his team, just as there was something in the fact that most of his players actually ran the other way to celebrate with Kenedy – another substitute and the man whose tackle, not exactly the thing he is known for, had started it all off. “This team is super-generous; I appreciate the work, the attitude, the solidarity. We’re a family. This team is an example of generosity, an example of football,” Bordalás said.', 'It is his example, his obsession. When Bordalás arrived just over three years ago, Getafe were near the foot of the second division. He took them to promotion, then to eighth, then fifth. Now, they’re safe again with 15 weeks to go. Intense, demanding, a little mad but with method, once seen as unsuited to the first division, too unsubtle for the top flight, what he has done is extraordinary. He has revived them all, moulding what might seem to be a motley crew into a hugely impressive football team, achieving beyond their wildest dreams.', 'Between them, his players have played more seasons in the second division than first and have experienced more relegations than they have winners’ medals, three times as many as they have league titles – and none of those are in Europe’s five biggest leagues. Only two of them are even in Europe, in fact: there’s an apertura and a clausura with River Plate, a Cameroonian title with Cotton Sport, two leagues with Dynamo Kyiv, two in Kazakhstan and that’s that. Yet here they are, third: ahead of Atlético and Sevilla, now five points and an unassailable head-to-head record ahead of Valencia, their 21st century rivals for whom, like most first division teams, they should be no match', 'Saturday’s starting XI has played just seven Champions League games ever, but that could change. As Molina put it: “it’s not chance.” If they might not be the third best team in Spain right now, it might only be because they’re the second. They have won four in a row without conceding a goal and although Barcelona and Sevilla are up next, plus Ajax in the Europa League, although there is a long way to go, safety has been secured for another season, leaving something greater before them. It will be hard, but if Getafe are anything it is hard, built to do what they can’t.', '“We don’t talk about that, day to day,” Bordalás said. “But you always dream, grow, improve, try to achieve big things. Today we played a team with a budget that is far, far greater than our own and we won with authority. I tell them: let’s enjoy this, keep working, because as soon as you stop, it ends, and see what happens next. There’s a very long way to go. We’re on a crossing, swimming. We’ve passed the equator and we can see the beach now. Don’t give up yet; keep on swimming until you reach the shore.”', 'Alavés 2–1 Eibar, Levante 2–0 Leganés, Getafe 3–0 Valencia, Valladolid 1–1 Villarreal, Atlético 1–0 Granada, Espanyol 1–0 Mallorca, Real Sociedad 2–1 Athletic, Osasuna 1–4 Madrid, Celta 2–1 Sevilla, Betis 2–3 Barcelona']","La Liga","Sport","2020-02-10",16.22,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca59be51fb4050af790f1b28b2c9553de4a6acce/0_7_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=bc1f62107ab56531ef7d6f04f16303b1","Jorge Molina celebrates after scoring one of two goals against Valencia in the 3-0 win.

  ["Murrayfield atmosphere reflected rising noise, bile and spite in rugby union","['Six Nations sees respect jettisoned for ill-feeling, as evidenced by Eddie Jones’s name-calling and fans jeering goalkickers']","['Few sports tread the fine line between love and hate as precariously as rugby union. It is part of its attraction: beauty and the beast occupy the same arena, passion and restraint are essential requirements. What has traditionally bound everything together is the realisation that, ultimately, it is a game that relies not only on the “rugby” for its enduring appeal but the collective power of “union”.', 'Essentially it boils down to a single word: respect. The code used to be simple: regardless of the intensity of the contest, be respectful to the referee, your opponents and the game itself. Increasingly, though, rugby is drifting in the opposite direction. Abusing the goalkickers, gesticulating at officials, booing players from a rival nation off the bus and blaming the media have become an all-too familiar part of the Six Nations backdrop.', 'It would be simple to file all this away under the heading “modern life” and criticise keyboard warriors on Twitter for helping to coarsen the atmosphere around top-level rugby – simple but a shade too convenient because it is about time rugby woke up to the self-inflicted damage being done by some within the game who should know better, not least coaches who overlook the link between their pre-match rhetoric and deteriorating relationships elsewhere.', 'When Eddie Jones talked about inflicting “absolute brutality” on France and dismissed the Scots as “niggly” one can be sure some of his employers at the Rugby Football Union were among those rolling their eyes. It helps to fuel the kind of atmosphere that, along with the wind and the rain, made its presence keenly felt at Murrayfield on Saturday when England were jeered on arrival and their captain Owen Farrell was booed when he kicked for goal.', 'Friendly rivalry is fine; centuries of history cannot be entirely rewritten, after all. But as the former Scotland international Peter Brown wrote in a thundering letter to the Times last week: “Hate is for terrorists. Not rugby players.”', 'Disliking someone based purely on their nationality is the most blinkered of traits; such intolerance is nothing to shout about. Stranded in Edinburgh by the weather over the weekend three of us were scooped up by two extremely kind rescuers, a Dutchman living in Ascot and a South African resident in Singapore. A seven-hour shared car odyssey and hundreds of miles of rugby chat later, it felt as if we had known each other for years.', 'Maybe it would help if more players were also encouraged to see the benefits of engaging with the media, to look past the occasional wince-inducing headline and recognise the opportunity to project themselves, both as athletes and as human beings. It might give some of them a more rounded perspective.', 'There is a massive amount to admire about Ellis Genge: his talent, his dynamism, his honesty and his refusal to be constrained by the perceptions of others. But when he dismisses “the sausages” who aired uncomplimentary views about England after the French game only to say nicer things post-Murrayfield, he is straying on to trickier terrain. Does that mean only he, Ellis, can tell it like it is? Is he saying the former internationals who were critical of the Parisian performance know nothing? Honesty at the top level is a two-way street.', 'At times it is easier said than done. One minute players are expected to be singing their hearts out during the anthems, the next to be completely calm. Or to smash their opponent into the middle of next week before getting up and calling the referee “sir”. It must occasionally be galling to listen to a coach or captain whose back you were protecting until recently delivering home truths from a well-remunerated pundit’s chair.', 'Maybe there are just too many podcasts, with too many babbling voices competing to be the noisiest, most controversial or the most indiscreet. Either way, there is way too much impatience and intolerance swilling around which, in turn, threatens the umbilical cord linking the game with its public.', 'Johnny Sexton is surely destined to become the best referee in the world, so often does he lecture those mere mortals currently trying to do the job. Jones writes disparagingly in his autobiography about the media “lunch club” and their “astounding vanity” without bothering to name names. Finn Russell savages Gregor Townsend’s coaching regime mid-tournament, in apparent retribution for the lack of understanding he believes has been shown towards him. Can they both be right? It is that same blurry fine line again, this time between free speech and fair comment.', 'No one wants rugby to become one big ocean of blandness. Then again, it is already tough enough not to require unnecessary bile and spite. Nor is it about people trying to cling to some absurd notion of moral superiority over other sports, as if that were ever true. It is more about people recognising they do not reside in some kind of bubble. Silence for kickers is fine but not if they take forever lining it up. If you make disparaging remarks about a rival nation at a press conference, do not then complain when someone abuses you in the street or on a train.', 'The presence of the remarkable Doddie Weir at Murrayfield was a timely reminder of what a real rugby ambassador looks like. If only out of respect for inspiring people like him, the trash talking has to stop.', 'On the touchline at the U20 international between Scotland and England at Myreside on Friday night, everyone was saying the same thing. “Look at the size of them,” muttered the spectator behind me. “They’re all absolutely massive.” He was not just talking about England, who traditionally love a big forward at age-group level, but the home side, too. Watching Scotland’s 6ft 2in tall fly-half, Nathan Chamberlain, up against England’s full-back Freddie Steward, who stands over 6ft 4in and weighs 101kg (15st 9lb), was to suspect Eddie Jones may be correct to predict the sport will become more and more about power. It will become an infinitely poorer game if smaller playmakers are all but squeezed out.', 'Here’s hoping that this year’s Women’s Six Nations is remembered for more than just one decisive opening round win by England over France and a lack of hot showers for Wales’s frozen players in Ireland at the weekend. The good news is that the media rights for the women’s games are to be sold under the same umbrella as the men’s international schedule from next season, hopefully ensuring better scheduling, more visibility and greater remuneration for those involved.

  ["Will small-ball eventually put an end to the NBA 7-footer?","['The Houston Rockets have begun playing without a center, and they are winning games. But there is still a place for the big man in basketball']","['Last month, the Houston Rockets took the NBA’s small-ball revolution to its logical extreme, defeating the Dallas Mavericks 128-121 without a player listed as taller than 6ft 6in. According to records, it was the first time an NBA team had done so since the 1963 Chicago Zephyrs beat the New York Knicks. The Chicago Zephyrs, for the record, were what the Washington Wizards used to be called three cities and four name changes ago. A lot has changed since then, but considering the evolution of the league, it was probably only a matter of time before a team repeated the Zephyrs’ feat.', 'How did the Rockets end up playing like this?', 'The Rockets’ starting center, the 6ft 10in Clint Capela, was injured, which left them with just reserve big men Tyson Chandler and Isaiah Hartenstein. Head coach Mike D’Antoni, never one to shy away from a controversial decision, left both of them on the bench. Instead, the Rockets played 6ft 5in PJ Tucker at center and opened up the offense in order to give James Harden and Russell Westbrook as much space as they wanted.', 'Were there any downsides to the Rockets playing so small?', 'Not if you ask Dallas’s 7ft 3in Kristaps Porzingis. With nobody on court to effectively challenge the center in the paint, he scored a season-high 35 points on 12-for-20 shooting. As you might imagine given the Rockets’ super-small lineup, the Mavericks also outrebounded the Rockets 52-37.', 'That sounds bad for Houston…', 'Well, the Rockets also managed to outscore the Mavericks while Porzingis was on the court. Shot selection might have been a factor, as Porzingis only attempted four three-pointers despite being an effective long-distance shooter. No team knows the value of the three-pointer more than the Rockets, you can pretty much see the story of the seven-point victory in the final three-point tallies: the Mavericks went 14-for-36, while the Rockets went 21-45.', 'Is it just me, or does everything in the NBA look a bit smaller these days?', 'It’s not just you. For a good chunk of its history, the NBA revolved around the center: there’s a reason that the position was called that in the first place. The Dominant Big Man was so key that their names came to define their eras: think George Mikan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal at his peak. These days, the key players around the league tend to be smaller, faster wings and forwards, with centers falling relatively low on the list of priorities when teams are building their rosters.', 'What has changed?', 'Well, much of it has to do with the growing importance of the three-point line. Although introduced in the league in the 1979-80 season, it took some time for teams to adapt to its existence and come to terms with the mathematical reality that shots worth three points were more valuable than those worth two. Eventually, though, teams started to de-emphasize the mid-range shot. With rare exceptions – Porzingis happens to be one of them – centers don’t tend to be the kind of sharp-shooters valued in the modern NBA.', 'It wasn’t just the three-pointer though. There’s a strong argument that the offensive explosion that we’ve seen in recent years was the result of defensive rule changes the league made at the start of the 21st century. The introduction of the three-second violation and an increased crackdown on hand-checking sped up the tempo of the game and helped make the stationary big man an endangered species.', 'So is the increased emphasis on small-ball just a result of rule changes?', 'Even if the NBA remained unchanged, it’s likely that we would have still seen a decrease in the importance of the big man. Over the last few decades, players have become quicker, more athletic and – this is key – more versatile. The center is starting to decline because positional differences themselves are less meaningful. This is reflected in the NBA All-Star Game, where voters no longer choose between forwards and centers but rather “frontcourt players.” In the past, a player’s physical type determined what role they played, but that’s no longer necessarily the case.', 'The level of competition alone would have altered the game. Yahoo! Sports’s Kelly Dwyer probably put this best in a piece he wrote about the center back in 2012, “at some point, even the quickest-thinking and quickest-spinning big men can’t keep up. And I don’t think that’s a problem … It wasn’t the centers that got smaller. It was the game that got bigger. And better.”', 'Can we expect the Rockets to keep this experiment going?', 'Apparently! On Thursday’s trade deadline, they dealt Capela to the Atlanta Hawks in a four-way deal, in which the tallest player they received was 6ft 9in small forward Robert Covington. As of now, Hartenstein and Chandler are the only true big men on the roster. That night they were playing the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers and the Rockets ended up stunning the Lakers at home, beating them 121-111. Westbrook, in particular, thrived in the undersized lineup, scoring 41 points. Maybe they could be on to something here.', 'Did that momentum carry over to their next game?', 'It very much did not. The next night, the Rockets suffered their worst loss of the season to the Utah Jazz. To be fair, they were resting Westbrook on the second night of back-to-back games.', 'Could the Rockets be ushering in a change in the league?', 'Let’s see how “very-small-ball” goes when opponents have had time to gameplan around it. The Rockets also happen to have a superb talent in Harden, who is the most efficient scorer in the game. They have teamed him with Westbrook, maybe the only other player who is as ball-dominant as Harden. Even if they manage to have playoff success with this kind of lineup, it’s not a formula that’s easy to replicate without players like Harden and Westbrook.', 'The era of the Dominant Big is probably gone for good, but size will always be valuable in the NBA. In an essay for FiveThirtyEight, Jared Dubin points out that, despite the Golden State Warriors’ success in recent years, contending teams are already starting to pivot back to the two big-man lineups. Most notably, the Philadelphia 76ers signed power forward/center Al Horford to play alongside their star center, Joel Embiid. While Philadelphia are still ironing out the kinks in this arrangement, the attempt alone shows that NBA teams remain unafraid to bet big.']","Houston Rockets","Sport","2020-02-11",9,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11b8a9436b9f01254648d89b4b4f3944b80c1c9/0_0_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4130b2c1b0a3255754131441a7ec3557","Houston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook drives to the basket during the NBA basketball game against the Dallas Mavericks in Houston.

  ["England may need to manage Jofra Archer differently, admits Silverwood","[' England coach says Archer may bowl shorter spells']","['Chris Silverwood has conceded for the first time he may look at managing Jofra Archer differently in Test cricket. The England coach said he could use Archer in shorter spells than has been the case but, if the situation demanded, he would still ask the paceman to bowl 40 overs in an innings.', '“Things like [bowling 40 overs] we have to look at,” Silverwood said. “But sometimes, when needs must, you’ve got to do it. We managed Mark Wood through both the Test matches he’s played here and he’s bowled in short sharp spells. Would we look to do that now with Jof? Yes, we probably would.”', 'Asked if there was any aspect of Archer’s handling he would alter if he could go back to October – a stress fracture of the right elbow has ruled out Archer for at least three months – Silverwood said there was nothing he would change.', '“Not really. It’s just a case of: his injury occurred. The first scan didn’t show us where it was. The second has. We can now put a plan in place and get him going for our summer.”', '“Being a fast bowler is hard work. It is hard work. Ask Jimmy, ask Broad, ask any of them. Being a fast bowler is hard work. It’s just how it is.”', 'Some outside the England camp have suggested the degree of hard work – Archer bowled more overs than any other England player in 2019 – was simply too much for someone in his first season of international cricket. Silverwood remains unconvinced.', '“We’ll never know, will we? We can’t turn the clock back, all we can do is look to the future and say, well, ‘How are we going to do it from now on?’”', 'Silverwood’s plan involves the exciting prospect of a closely managed group of Test fast bowlers, with an Australia-style rotation policy to keep them fresh.', '“My dream, my ideal is to have three fast bowlers fit at any given point so we can rotate them, so they’re not always playing, and at any given point I’ve got one sat with his feet up full of energy waiting to go. So when he comes in he can go and hit the game hard, and just keep that going. That is the dream. We have to make it reality.”', 'As it stands, Archer, Wood and Olly Stone are already part of Silverwood’s planning for the next Ashes series in Australia.', '“I would love to have those for the Ashes because we all know we get judged on the Ashes, so how can we give ourselves the best chance of succeeding? If I have three of them fit there, whether it is those three or not, then it would be a great advantage for us.', '“I am excited to see Jofra and Wood in the same team. As an ex-fast bowler that would be exciting. But you have to get the right conditions to do that.”', 'Silverwood was speaking before England’s flight to East London for the start of the three-match T20 leg of their South Africa tour. It is a series England will be going all-out to win as part of their preparation for the T20 World Cup, a slight change of emphasis from the experimental lineups of the ODIs. Silverwood also spoke of his own commitment to carrying on the high-throttle style of England’s white-ball cricket in the Morgan-Bayliss era.', '“We’re going to keep being aggressive. That’s how we’re going to break records and this team can break records. We’ve seen it time and time again. They play exciting cricket. I love watching it, they love playing it and it’s been a successful formula for them.

Others might question the basic process of lumping India and Sri Lanka together as one cricketing landscape, given they remain separate nations with separate lineups and separate conditions.', 'For Jennings Sri Lanka presents an opportunity to push his case for selection not just as a South Asian specialist but across all conditions. “ I wouldn’t speculate about Test matches in six months’ time,” said Ed Smith, England’s national selector. “However, I would say that Keaton’s recall fits with what we need in this circumstance which is top-order depth with experience of playing in those conditions.”', 'As it stands, with Rory Burns missing the tour because of an ankle injury, Jennings, Dominic Sibley, Zak Crawley and Joe Denly will compete for three top-order batting spots, with Denly’s part-time leg-spin thrown in the hat as an extra bargaining chip.', 'Bairstow’s omission is consistent with his status as squad player in need of a rest after playing in all formats recently. Smith spoke of Bairstow simply needing to take his chances when they come in red-ball cricket.', '“There is a general understanding that players who are extremely busy in the IPL and international calendar, they don’t always get much chance to play domestic or even tour first-class matches.', '“However, the best plan for Jonny is to perform at a very high level whenever those opportunities come along. Opportunities for him in South Africa were scarce – he just got one Test match – but obviously if he can grab those opportunities when they come around, that is his best way forward.”', 'Jos Buttler retains his place despite averaging 21 in the last 12 months and passing 50 once in 19 innings. The selection of Foakes covers a situation where England might prefer a high-class specialist wicket-keeper. Buttler has at times been a porous presence standing up to the stumps against spin. Foakes made his Test debut in Galle in November 2018 and scored a first innings century', 'The strong suggestion from England is that Buttler remains first choice, with a great deal of emphasis placed on “continuity”. “He is a very talented player and he’s very highly regarded inside the team,” said Smith. “I think there is a lot of support for Jos’s talent.”', 'Joe Root (Yorkshire, capt), Dom Bess (Somerset), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Sam Curran (Surrey), Joe Denly (Kent), Ben Foakes (Surrey), Keaton Jennings (Lancashire), Jack Leach (Somerset), Matthew Parkinson (Lancashire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Dominic Sibley (Warwickshire), Ben Stokes (Durham, vice-capt), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham)', 'The fast bowling is in the hands of Mark Wood, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran. Given England’s stated policy of rotating their fast bowlers there is a possibility Broad and Wood might play one game apiece. Woakes and Curran would look to be contesting one spot.', 'England will have three spin bowlers of diverse methods on tour: Jack Leach, Dominic Bess and Matthew Parkinson. The fact none of these spinners is centrally contracted is indicative of the open nature of selection. Adil Rashid has very strongly ruled himself out of contention. Moeen is still not mentally ready to resume full-time red ball cricket.', 'The two-match series offers the chance to pick up points in the World Test Championship, so England will be keen to start well, something that has been an issue on recent overseas tours.

Morelos’s representatives, World in Motion, did not comment when approached by the Guardian.

However, when the Mets move north to New York for the regular season the team’s minor league outfit, the St Lucie Mets, will not be allowed to use the new clubhouse, instead using older, more basic facilities elsewhere in the building.

  ["Why Premier League clubs are turning to an Australian bank in big numbers","['Teams in England’s top two divisions are taking sizeable loans from Macquarie, at times mortgaged against future TV earnings']","['It was once dubbed the “vampire kangaroo” and accused of “feasting on Britain’s creaking infrastructure” after investing in companies such as Thames Water and avoiding tax through a legal but controversial web of subsidiaries in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. But Macquarie Group Limited is a growing influence on English football, underlined on one day last month by Leicester and Wolves extending sizeable loans with the Australian investment bank that are mortgaged against future TV earnings.', 'Now with a portfolio that also includes Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Southampton, Swansea City, Watford, West Brom and Wolves, a company estimated to manage almost £288bn worth of assets has emerged as the second-biggest lender, behind Barclays bank, in an industry where owners continue to chase the dream. Since 2013, and encouraged by increased transparency in the game following the introduction of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations, Macquarie estimates that it has completed more than $1.5bn in loans across Europe’s major leagues, specialising in “transfer financing” and “media and sponsorship rights monetisation”.', 'Any club that uses such a facility must register a charge – security against the loan – with Companies House. The latest arrangement with Wolves, registered on 13 January, extends their £50m lending facility until March 2021.', 'That means part of the credits of future TV income – worth £130m a season under the latest deal – have been transferred to Macquarie in exchange for their capital, although it is not known how much interest Wolves will pay to receive the money in advance.', 'The latest charge registered by Leicester was also added on 13 January. But rather than being evidence of more borrowing, this was because the arrangement has to be ratified every six months by the Premier League, which distributes TV rights from its central fund.', '“Every time [a club] renew, effectively they are extending the length of the overdraft and it means that Macquarie are entitled to the money from the next tranche of TV money from the Premier League,” explains Kieran Maguire, who is a senior teacher at the University of Liverpool’s Management School and specialises in football finance. “There’s an awful lot of clubs doing this and it makes a lot of sense. The broadcasting payments are made three or four times a year but you’ve got all of the overheads going out in between, including the wage bill.', '“I understand that a lot of banks are providing similar services but, because they are not formally registering a charge, we don’t see the documentation because nothing is going through Companies House. It’s a risk in the same way that if you take out a mortgage and it helps from a cash flow point of view.”', 'Leicester’s relationship with Macquarie began in October 2018, three months after Riyad Mahrez joined Manchester City for £60m. As is common in most modern transfers, Pep Guardiola’s side were due to pay in instalments, with the final £36m due in two tranches by the end of July this year. Enter Macquarie. In exchange for the £36m, Leicester agreed a secured borrowing facility that means the transfer fee will be paid to Macquarie instead.', 'A similar service is provided by XXIII Capital, the company which has financed several multimillion transfer deals including Antoine Griezmann’s €120m move to Barcelona and that of his replacement at Atlético Madrid, João Félix.', 'Known in the business as “transfer factoring”, it has become an increasingly popular way of raising finance quickly to enable clubs to compete in the transfer market and deal with spiralling wage bills. But with interest rates estimated to be at least 6%-7%, the risks are clear.', 'Leicester’s latest loan does not specify how much they can borrow from Macquarie, although it is the sixth time they have entered an arrangement with the lender.', 'The second – made in December 2018 – has been satisfied but was reported at the time to be larger than the first arrangement over Mahrez and had been earmarked to help fund a new training ground and expand the King Power Stadium.', 'Two more are outstanding, although Maguire does not believe there is any evidence of financial difficulties at a club on course to qualify for the Champions League.', '“What will often happen is that you might have separate charge arrangements over separate assets belonging to the club,” he says. “It could be something as simple as that – I don’t think there is anything Machiavellian in it.”', 'Macquarie says it is selective about who it does business with. It has been marketing its services directly to English clubs and many have jumped at the opportunity to improve their cash flow.', 'Southampton, who previously borrowed money from the mysterious Vibrac Corporation that came under scrutiny from MPs in 2016, have a long-established relationship, having first taken out a loan in November 2016 secured against future TV rights. They have since returned annually and filed a new charge in the summer.', 'Meanwhile, Macquarie purchased half of the credits owed to Crystal Palace from the £45m transfer of Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United last summer. Courtesy of the bank, Bournemouth received the £12m then owed by Aston Villa for the England defender Tyrone Mings 12 months earlier than scheduled. Even Craig Dawson’s £5.5m move to Watford in the summer led West Brom to take out a £2,395,300 loan, corresponding to the amount of the fee they were due to be paid in June 2021.', 'Swansea’s first loan with Macquarie after they sold the Spanish midfielder Roque Mesa in June 2018 was satisfied last week, although the Championship club have two outstanding arrangements made almost 18 months ago. High-interest repayments from what Maguire describes as “boutique lenders” have become a feature of the multibillion-pound industry that is modern football but he does not think it necessarily spells trouble.', '“Any form of borrowing comes with an element of risk,” he says. “But fans might also take the view that if the club borrows and invests that on the pitch with players then that is likely to reduce the risk of relegation, therefore assuring the club of another year’s TV money. It’s a double-edged sword.', '“In an ideal world I think most fans would prefer that the club owner takes on the form of a benevolent dictator and gifts the club the money through an interest-free loan, like Farhad Moshiri has done at Everton. But they are always much harder to find.”']","Premier League","Sport","2020-02-11",15.3,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f628ecd19bd36de2cf0439fd4146726bad4eb13c/68_0_4121_2474/master/4121.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=51a011acb61918090c2e13a24a161d94","Leicester and Wolves extended loans with Macquarie on the same day in January.

  ["Gérard Houllier: the man who helped to make Liverpool great again","['The Frenchman had a profound impact on Liverpool and arguably deserves more adoration from the Anfield faithful']","['Radio is a terrible way to follow football. There will be those who disagree - they call themselves ‘purists’ - but commentary, even at its most vivid, without accompanying pictures leads to a fog of unclarity and uncertainty. Chances for the opposition team feel more threatening than they are whereas those for your own never seem to be anywhere near goal.', 'But sometimes radio is the only way to follow football, and sometimes it does provide the full picture. Like it did on the evening of Tuesday, 10 November 1998. I was 17 at the time, a Liverpool fanatic and alone in my bedroom listening to coverage of my team’s League Cup tie against Tottenham on a CD player that happened to have AM radio. The sound was fuzzy and the lack of visuals not ideal, but I got a sense of everything. Crucially, I felt it too. It felt like the end.', 'Liverpool came into the game on the back of three games without victory, two of which had been Premier League defeats. They were also playing poorly, as had been the case for some time, and the supporters, so proud of their loyalty and sense of strength in adversity, were starting to give up. There was a crowd of just 20,772 at Anfield that night and they were the unlucky ones as Liverpool went on to lose 3-1. It was a pitiful performance played out in eerie, desperate silence.', 'And it really was the end - the end of Roy Evans’ and Gérard Houllier’s joint managership. It had started that summer after Evans had been the sole manager for the previous four years and 10 months. He had done a good job, returning a sense of pride and pizzazz to the club after Graeme Souness’ troubled spell in charge. Homegrown players such as Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman peaked having been given their wings by a man steeped in Liverpool’s boot room tradition and the team won things. Well, one thing - the 1995 League Cup.', 'They also challenged for the title but, ultimately, that was Evans’ downfall; Liverpool came close but never close enough and by the end of his reign were slipping backwards in that pursuit. A once-mighty institution was sinking into an abyss of mid-table and trophy-starved mediocrity and, as such, change was required. That meant Houllier coming in, initially to work alongside Evans. But it didn’t work and after the loss to Spurs, the latter departed.', 'Houllier’s first match as sole manager came that Saturday and once again it ended in a 3-1 home defeat, this time to Leeds. Anfield was full on this occasion and those in attendance could have been forgiven for thinking nothing was ever going to change. But it would. For in the dugout there was a Frenchman with a revolutionary spirit and he would save Liverpool Football Club.', 'That may sound like a wild overstatement but the evidence is pretty clear. Across Houllier’s five full seasons in charge, Liverpool won five major pieces of silverware, with three of those forming the remarkable treble of 2000-01, a campaign in which the club also returned to Europe’s elite competition, the Champions League, for the first time in a generation. The following year there was also a second-place finish resulting from a final tally of 80 points, Liverpool’s highest during the Premier League era and enough to have won a 19th league championship in four of the previous five campaigns.', 'Liverpool were a force again, at home and abroad, and while ultimately Houllier’s time at the club ended with no league title and, as most managerial reigns do, messily and regretfully, his impact was profound, on and off the pitch. The Frenchman not only got Liverpool winning again but he did so with a squad that through practice and mental fortitude had finally entered the modern era. More than that, he brought through a core of players who long after his departure would continue to thrive.', 'Some would call it a legacy, and one of real poignancy given Houllier almost died making Liverpool great again. The story is well known but bears repeating: at half-time of a league fixture with Leeds in October 2001, Liverpool’s manager suffered a dissected aorta that required him to undergo an emergency bypass operation lasting over 11 hours. He wouldn’t have made it had it not been for a series of fortunate circumstances and, arguably, things would not have unravelled so fast and drastically had Houllier not returned to work so soon, which he did through a sense of duty, drive and passion.', 'That is the other beguiling aspect of the story - managing Liverpool was not a cold assignment for him but rather a calling dating back to the late 1960s when he moved to the city in order to work as a teaching assistant at Alsop Comprehensive, a former grammar school located less than a couple of miles away from Anfield. Houllier fell in love with his surroundings and, a football fanatic for as long as he could remember, it was no surprise he found himself drawn to the local team that played in red. Bill Shankly’s Liverpool were on the march and Houllier breathed in their fire, no more so than on the night he stood on the Kop and watched the hosts dismantle Dundalk 10-0 in a Uefa Cup tie.', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'He eventually returned to France where teaching morphed into a hugely successful coaching career that peaked with the Ligue 1 title he won with Paris Saint-Germain in 1986. Come the summer of 1997, he was being asked by Peter Robinson, Liverpool’s chief executive, if he would like to return to the city, this time to manage the club he once watched and still adored.', 'Houllier turned down the invitation as he was in the midst of overseeing France’s pursuit of the 1998 World Cup in his role as technical director with the French Football Federation, but with that triumph achieved and his contract with the FFF having expired, he decided the time was right to take on the job of his dreams, doing so on the basis that Evans remained. It was a curious state of affairs - Liverpool’s first foreign boss working as a joint manager with somebody who had already been in the post for some time. Both insisted it could work; both probably knew deep down that it wouldn’t.', 'Clear lines of communication was an issue - the players didn’t know who to speak to and who, actually, was in charge. Their approach was an issue, too. Evans was old-school, trusting his players to largely regulate their own diet and fitness, which meant even in the 1990s, a period when English football was going through profound change, there were players at the country’s most successful club eating beans and sausage on toast as a pre-match meal and skipping sessions in the gym if they felt like it. The ‘Spice Boys’ tag may have been overplayed but it also struck at a truth.', 'Indeed, this is why Houllier was brought into Liverpool in the first place. Robinson recognised his coaching credentials but also his ability to instil discipline and a greater level of professionalism in regards to how the club operated. The hope was that could be achieved with Evans, a hugely popular and loyal servant for over 35 years, sharing the managerial hot seat. But ultimately a clean break was required. “It would be easy to stay, but to give Gérard and his team a chance you have to walk away,” said a teary Evans at the press conference held to announce his departure. “I didn’t want to end as a ghost on the wall.”', 'Houllier’s style was as different to Evans’ as ballet is to jazz but that did not mean him kicking the door down at Liverpool’s Melwood training base on day one of becoming sole manager and demanding everyone did 20 push-ups on the spot. A former schoolteacher who knew how to impose himself on a group of young men, Houllier may have wanted to do that, but he recognised that making sweeping changes could significantly harm his authority in the way it had done Souness at the start of the decade. So instead he went about things gradually. There was no French revolution.', 'Having brought in former club captain Phil Thompson to be his assistant, Houllier essentially used the remainder of the 1998-99 season as a recce, observing what was working and, more importantly, what needed to change. That eventually led to overhauls in nutrition and fitness, training sessions becoming more focused on tactics and defending and, most profoundly, a sweep of the squad.', 'The end of that campaign, one in which Liverpool finished seventh and a yawning 25 points behind champions Manchester United, saw a host of players leave, most notably captain Paul Ince. In author Simon Hughes’ book Ring of Fire, Houllier insists he liked Ince and recognised he was a “fantastic player”, but through those initial observations he also recognised that the self-styled ‘Guv’nor’ was an overbearing presence in the dressing room and the organiser of one too many nights out. Quite simply Ince had to go, and he did, joining Middlesbrough for £1m in July 1999. Other established figures were also sold, including David James, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Bjørn Tore Kvarme, while McManaman left on a free transfer having signed a contract with Real Madrid the previous January. His exit, unlike the others, was a blow but it was a further sign that Liverpool were moving on.', 'It was at this point that Houllier displayed one of the assets that made him such an impactful, successful manager: recruitment. It’s one thing getting rid of bad players, it’s another signing the right ones to replace them, but that is what Houllier did ahead of his first full season in charge. By and large, the names were unknown and underwhelming - Sami Hyypiä, Stéphane Henchoz, Titi Camara, Erik Meijer, Sander Westerveld, Dietmar Hamann - but they embodied exactly what the manager wanted. As Houllier puts it in Ring of Fire, “We signed a group of players from different countries, different leagues and different attitudes - probably more in tune with what happened elsewhere. Sometimes you need to change and evolve.”', 'That is certainly what Liverpool did. Not long into the new season, it was obvious this was a very different side to that which had performed under Evans - less adventurous but also less flaky, operating with a level of organisation, doggedness and steel that had been absent for most of the previous decade. Hyypiä and Henchoz were crucial to that, forming a superb centre-back partnership that was well protected by Hamann, who, having overcome an injury in the opening-day victory over Sheffield Wednesday, developed into one of the most impressive defensive midfielders in the country.', 'It may not have been pretty but it was effective and inside 12 months Liverpool jumped from seventh to fourth on the back of the best defence in the land, conceding just 30 goals in 38 fixtures. They missed out on Champions League qualification by two points following a final day defeat to Bradford but, overall, it had been a positive campaign, in part because, alongside the contributions of the initially-mysterious foreign imports, there were those from a core of homegrown talent.', 'This touches on one of the great myths of Houllier’s time at Liverpool - that he stripped the club of its English heart. The truth is that there were not many other managers, before or after the Frenchman, who gave more players from this country a chance. David Thompson, Dominic Matteo, Danny Murphy and Jamie Redknapp all featured during the 1999-2000 season, as did Michael Owen, having by that stage cemented his status as the hot thing of English football. And then there was Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard who in different ways are testimony to Houllier’s belief that one of his main responsibilities as Liverpool manager was to help the club’s young players progress.', 'Given his debut by Evans in 1997, Carragher was a hard-working but limited player whose somewhat reckless off-field nature put him in danger of wasting a career before it had properly started. Few would have blamed Houllier if he turned his back on the Bootle-born star, but instead he took the time to get to know Carragher, recognising that he was a youth team graduate who maintained a wild side but was also willing to listen and improve. “Jamie was clever in reading the game and learning from his experiences, both good and bad,” Houllier says in Ring of Fire. “He was patient with himself and patient with me and I explained to him from the beginning that I saw him as a player who would find himself.”', 'That is what Carragher did, getting his head down in 1999-2000 as a versatile centre-back or full-back option, going onto have a Liverpool career that spanned 17 years and over 700 appearances for the club. ‘Carra’ became a bona fide Anfield legend. ', 'The situation with Gerrard was more straightforward in that it was obvious to Houllier as soon as he saw the midfielder play in a youth game against Blackburn that he had the talent and desire to make it at the top level. The issue instead was growing pains - Gerrard’s teenage frame struggled with the demands of men’s football, leading to him collecting numerous injuries having made his debut for the first team, again against Blackburn, on 29 November 1998. Patience more than guidance was required and that is what Houllier showed, even sending Gerrard to France to be treated by a team of physiotherapists with the firm belief that, long term, it would lead to this most precocious of talents being able to put a string of games together. He did, and then some.', 'Not all of the homegrown players progressed under Houllier, with Thompson and Matteo not even getting past that first season. They were sold to Coventry and Leeds respectively in the summer of 2000 as Houllier went on another transfer splurge, bringing in the likes of Markus Babbel and Gary McAllister to add guile and experience to a squad that showed itself to be short of those qualities in the final few weeks of the previous campaign. Again, Houllier’s sense of what was required in recruitment proved spot-on as Liverpool enjoyed their most successful season from a trophy-winning point of view since 1983-84.', 'The treble was the undeniable high point of Houllier’s time at Liverpool, and while the team were fortunate to win the FA Cup final - when Owen single-handedly turned a game that had been well and truly going Arsenal’s way - they showed incredible resilience and quality throughout a long and gruelling campaign. It was also one littered with memorable results – home and away wins against Manchester United and Everton as well as a Uefa Cup semi-final victory over Barcelona that included a masterful goalless draw at Camp Nou in the first leg. It was a game which, more than any other, showed how mature and tactically astute Liverpool had become under Houllier. How they were finally back to being a ‘proper’ team.', 'Everything was set up for Liverpool to push on and that is what they did in the 2001-02 season, finishing above Manchester United for the first time in the Premier League era and only missing out on the title to an Arsenal side that went on to land a second double in four years. But that campaign was ultimately the beginning of the end, in part because of what happened to the man in the charge on what should have been a relatively straightforward autumn afternoon.', 'Houllier was rushed to hospital at half-time of the Leeds game with chest pains. He initially thought it was down to flu and was keen to get out for the second half, especially given Liverpool were trailing 1-0. But having taken his blood pressure, Mark Waller, the club doctor, insisted he went to hospital and, as Houllier outlines in Ring of Fire, the timing proved critical. “At full time there was unbelievable traffic around Anfield and the ambulance would not have got through. At half-time, this was not the case. I was very lucky.”', 'There followed more luck: the hospital Houllier was taken to, Broadgreen, was just one of three cardio specialist units in the country, and the surgeon who operated on him was meant to be away but had decided to stay in Liverpool because he was feeling tired.', 'Houllier’s operation was a success but it meant him being signed off from work for an entire year. Thompson took charge of the team in his absence and did a fine job, maintaining Liverpool’s upward momentum in the league and Champions League. He could well have carried on until May but such was Houllier’s desire to get back to work that he returned to the dugout inside five months, appearing, unannounced, ahead of the visit of Roma in March 2002. It was an uplifting moment that sent Anfield into rapture, but it was shocking to see just how frail Houllier had become. This once straight-backed and imposing presence was now gaunt and hollow-eyed. He was a reduced man and, as events would prove, a reduced manager.', 'The biggest failing came in the area Houllier had been so strong - recruitment. The Frenchman’s judgement appeared to have deserted him, leading to a string of signings in the summer of 2002 that derailed Liverpool’s attempts to improve on their runners-up place from the previous campaign. El Hadji-Diouf, Salif Diao and Bruno Cheyrou … names to make all Liverpool fans shudder.', 'Tactically the team also lost its way. The solidity in defence evaporated while in midfield and attack Liverpool became stodgy, ragged and largely ineffective. It culminated in a collapse from second in 2001-02 to fifth and outside of the Champions League places in 2002-03. And while a fourth-place finish and subsequent return to Europe’s top table was achieved the following campaign, it was not enough to save Houllier, especially given Liverpool finished 30 points behind Arsenal.', 'Houllier insists the effects of his heart scare have been overplayed, claiming it was down to genetics rather than stress, and rather than impair his judgement it hampered his ability to do his job on a practical level. For instance, he had to rest more at home after surgery, which in turn meant fewer overseas trips to scout players, which in turn meant making signings based on trust rather than due diligence, which in turn led to the likes of Diouf, Diao and Cheyrou arriving at Anfield. That may be true but, as the cliché goes, football is a results business and by the end the results were simply not good enough, at home or abroad, with Liverpool exiting the 2002-03 Champions League at the group stages after a tepid 3-3 draw with Swiss side Basel. The manager also appeared to be feeling the strain, lashing out at outside criticism and justifying his methods in the flimsiest of manners.', 'His departure was inevitable and ushered in a new era: the Rafa Benítez era. Soon Liverpool fans would be celebrating the miracle of Istanbul and a catalogue of other glorious European occasions. Juventus, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter, Real Madrid. Stories to tell the grandchildren.', 'Benítez is rightly revered by Liverpool fans for what he achieved during his six years at the club, but that also begs the question why Houllier is not held in the same esteem for what he did during his time on Merseyside. For while the Frenchman, now aged 72 and having not managed since a stint at Aston Villa in 2010-11, will never have to buy a pint around Anfield, the lack of love for him in those parts is glaring. His name is rarely mentioned let alone sung, while his face is not visible anywhere among the kaleidoscope of banners and flags that adorn the Kop.', 'In part, that may be because he never won either of the trophies that really matter to Kopites – the league or European Cup – and also perhaps because of the way it ended. It may even have something to do with Houllier’s relationship with Fowler, which deteriorated to the point that a player known as ‘God’ among the fans felt he had no option but to leave and join Leeds in November 2001. Regardless, almost 16 years since Houllier himself left Liverpool, there is no denying his achievements while in charge of the club are worthy of great appreciation.', 'It really cannot be overestimated how great the sense of drift was at Liverpool in the late 1990s, caught perfectly in that bleak night at a half-empty Anfield in November 1998, resulting from the decay that often sets in at mighty clubs in their post-imperial years. Houllier reversed the tide through his intelligence, instincts and talent, and what was ultimately important to him was not just what he won but what he left behind. Gerrard, for one, is grateful for having Gérard Houllier around during his formative years at Liverpool, describing him as a “father figure”.', '“The fans don’t truly appreciate what Gérard did for the club,” says Thompson. “He worked tirelessly, rebuilding the team. Above all, it shouldn’t be forgotten that he nearly gave his life to make Liverpool great again.”', 'This article was first published by These Football Times as part of their special Liverpool edition.']","Liverpool","Sport","2020-02-11",13,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262372f9d838a013b599d905df7deb550bd64adb/0_21_1133_680/master/1133.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=798aa8a5b56b25a79ccbba5a5b59e6ae","Gérard Houllier did not win a league title at Liverpool but he belatedly dragged the club into the modern era.

  ["Uefa hopes Disney magic can help inspire more young girls into football","['Head of women’s football Nadine Kessler says grassroots initiative Playmakers can empower youngsters, with an assist from The Incredibles’ Elastigirl']","['Uefa has today launched a radical European-wide grassroots initiative, called Playmakers, targeting girls aged five to eight in line with the ruling body of the European game’s aim to double participation in women’s and girl’s football across the continent by 2024. Uefa’s head of women’s football, Nadine Kessler, told the Guardian that the programme, which has been backed by Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic and Scotland’s Erin Cuthbert, two of the countries involved in the initial rollout, shows a commitment to the game from top to bottom.', 'Kessler, who won the Women’s Euro with Germany in 2013 and Fifa’s world player of the year in 2014, added: “The growth over the last five years has been significant. We’ve really worked hard not just to get a strategic plan in place but one that is going to be action-led hence the name: Time for Action.', '“The changes to the Women’s Champions League format, the centralisation of rights and now Playmakers at the grassroots level are one after the other being rolled out and underline that we are committed and serious and willing to do our bit to build the women’s game as much as possible.”', 'The Playmakers programme has been developed following extensive research carried out by Leeds Beckett University, on behalf of Europe’s governing body. The university studied what motivates young girls’ participation in sport and looked to identify the best coaching practices. It concluded that there were many positive benefits to play-based education. It also established a knowledge transfer partnership with the Football Association.', '“We have devised a programme that offers a different route, a different choice. Something that is for girls who are completely new to football,” Kessler said. “We always target those ones that are a little bit interested but we are also targeting those that don’t have any interest in sport or football at all. We are really trying to capture a whole new generation of girls.”', 'Like the FA’s Shooting Stars programme, Playmakers is being run in partnership with Disney. When the FA announced the link-up there was criticism of the idea that girls should aspire to be like Disney princesses. Kessler, though, believes that is short-sighted and says the company can both help reach parents and enhance girls’ play using a story-based methodology.', 'Kessler said: “This is actually more about empowering females and little girls, allowing them to make decisions, embracing differences and providing an environment where they can be creative and have a lot of choice, instead of just providing the traditional pathway. This programme is all about female empowerment and how healthy they can be doing sport. The message is that football is fun – just express yourself, try it out, explore it.', '“If you look at The Incredibles 2 [which the initial 10 sessions will be based upon] Elastigirl is a woman who saves the world and is a mum. We’ll pick stories, films and characters that aren’t the stereotypical princess-like stories.”', 'Seven countries are involved in the initial rollout of the programme, beginning with Belgium in March, with the aim of being in every European country by the end of 2021.', '“We really had a close look at where to roll out the programme first. The seven pilot countries were a) countries that were super-motivated in implementing the programme, and b) because we have different countries from different regions it will help us draw the right conclusions from our pilot, work out the scale of the project and ensure the quality of the delivery, which is the most pivotal part of what we’re doing.”', 'Delivering the programme in countries where the development and acceptance of women’s football ranges widely will be a test, Kessler said: “The situation in each country is unique and needs to be approached in a unique way. I really hope it will give more proof to encourage more girls but also send the message that football is a sport for girls and women. How we promote and communicate and market Playmakers will be essential in how much we are able to change and challenge perceptions.”', 'With the FA having admitted that it has lacked the coaches to fully capitalise on the interest following the Women’s World Cup last summer, could Uefa struggle similarly? Kessler believes not. “Our coaches will follow our coaching methodology strictly, we have coach educators that will train the coaches on the ground and are the most decisive factor in the delivery of the programme,” she said. “We see that the interest is there but we have to keep working to find more talent. We don’t see that as a stumbling block at the moment but it’s certainly an area we need to focus on.”', 'Being flexible in their approach is also important. “Playmakers will not necessarily be rolled out through federations,” Kessler said. “It can be through clubs or regions. We want to have a programme that is flexible, that goes where the girls are and helps them to have a choice that they’ve not had before.”']","Women's football","Sport","2020-02-13",8,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b5468c86e663fa855dabb6e51c3d07cf421c37/123_84_1659_996/master/1659.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=6b8d52a1b578364cffc16bedc50b1754","Uefa’s Playmakers is aimed at increasing girls’ interest in football among the five-to-eight age group.

  ["Scott Parker unhappy with Millwall equaliser as Fulham are frustrated","['Fulham left the Den with a point, but Scott Parker was unhappy after Jon Dadi Bodvarsson’s goal was allowed to stand. “It was clear as day that they had two players offside,” Parker said afterwards. “Who [the pass] comes off is perhaps in question, but anyone would think it’s a little bit unjust to think that a goal was given when there’s clearly an advantage from two of their players standing in an offside position.”']","['Bodvarsson’s seventh-minute goal cancelled out Aleksandar Mitrovic’s third-minute opener, and Jed Wallace blazed a penalty over the bar for Millwall before the interval. “I think our reaction after the goal was pretty poor, and in the first half we turned the game into what Millwall wanted it to be,” Parker added.', '“In the second half we got a grip on the game. We stamped our mark on it, which I asked for at half-time because we needed to be braver. The pitch and the conditions were tough to deal with, but that’s the way I want my team to play - we have to take the sting out of the game. Overall I think we’re happy with a point, and we’re six games unbeaten now.”', 'It could have been three but Neeskens Kebano hit the crossbar with a header in injury time which would have taken them into second place. The draw puts Fulham back level with second-placed Leeds but out of the automatic promotion places on goal difference, while Millwall are now seven points off the play-off pace.', 'Alex Neil’s first visit to the Bet365 Stadium since spurning Stoke’s advances earlier in the season proved to be a positive one as his Preston side closed the gap on the automatic places to three points with a 2-0 win. Stoke were dominant for the first hour but North End went ahead with their first shot on target, after 58 minutes, when a corner ricocheted off Ben Davies and Alan Browne reacted fastest to poke home from inside the six-yard box. And Tom Barkhuizen doubled their lead 15 minutes from time, with Davies nodding down Paul Gallagher’s cross for the former Morecambe forward to stroke home.', '““We showed different strengths from what we normally do. We showed great resolve, great grit and did the basics really well. That was certainly one of our poorest performances in quite a while but we got the job done,” Neil said. “We’re three points off second – we just need to get across the line. It wasn’t pretty – nobody’s talking about this game in a week’s time.”', 'Bristol City kept up the pressure on Preston and the playoff places with a 3-2 win over Derby, who scored their goals through Martyn Waghorn and Chris Martin in the last half‑hour and made for a nervous finish at Ashton Gate. The hosts took a 38th-minute lead when Niclas Eliasson’s deep cross from the right was volleyed back across goal by Jay Dasilva for Nakhi Wells to mark his first start for the club with a powerful header. It was 2-0 just before the interval as Derby were again found wanting in the air. Famara Diedhiou’s header from a corner was blocked, but Filip Benkovic pounced to nod home.', 'The Rams did not learn their lesson either, and Ashley Williams headed down another Eliasson cross for Diedhiou to volley home a third after 58 minutes. Three minutes later Waghorn dived to head home and spark a spell of intense pressure.Luton lifted themselves off the bottom with a 1-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday, James Collins scoring in the 23rd minute to take his side to within seven points of safety and condemn the Owls to their sixth defeat in nine league games.', 'Cardiff won 3-0 at relegation-threatened Huddersfield, first-half goals from Josh Murphy and Will Vaulks doing the bulk of the damage as the Bluebirds climbed two places to maintain their push for a play-off place. And Callum Paterson bagged a 69th-minute third to put the contest out of reach as City extended their impressive league run to just one defeat from their last 11 matches.', '“We’re on a good run of form,” said their manager, Neil Harris. “We’re getting into a nice position but you have to keep doing it at this level.

That could put further financial pressure on UK Athletics, whose reserves have dropped from more than £4.5m in 2016 to £2.8m last year.', 'Sources fear the BBC holds all the bargaining chips in the negotiations because UK Athletics has been rocked by a series of crises and poor performances, and is now the subject of an unprecedented UK Sport review.', 'While the current BBC deal, agreed in 2013, was the result of lengthy but fruitful talks, it is understood that nowhere near as much progress has been made this time round.', 'UK Athletics’ bargaining position has not been helped by the absence of a chief executive for the past 17 months after Niels de Vos, who negotiated the current deal, moved on. However sources say the organisation was slow to act – much to the surprise of the BBC, which not only pays UK Athletics £3m in rights fees but also, unusually, pays its own production costs.', 'Apart from brief spells with ITV and Channel 4 in the 80s and 90s, the BBC has been UK Athletics’ main broadcast partner for the past four decades. However a spokesperson for the sport left open the possibility that this might change.', 'While insisting UK Athletics had made “good progress in our discussions with a number of potential broadcast partners including the BBC”, the spokesperson told the Guardian major events do “not need to be exclusive to one provider and this is where more options are becoming available to us with the best levels of financial return”.', 'The organisation also believes that World Athletics’ new 10-year deal with the Chinese broadcaster Wanda will help boost its finances.', 'Meanwhile Frank Dick, the British Athletics director of coaching between 1979 and 1994, during the golden age of the sport, has told the Guardian he believes UK Sport has received “a pretty shoddy return on investment” from UKA since lottery funding began in 1997.', 'UK Athletics has been given more than £110m to fund elite athletics over the past 23 years but Dick, who also guided Daley Thompson to successive Olympic decathlon gold medals in 1980 and 1984 and recently worked with the England rugby team, said track and field had not capitalised on that support because of a lack of leadership and a series of poor decisions.', '“There has to be a strong strategic vision, over a four-year Olympic cycle, and I don’t think there is one,” said Dick. “I have had the enormous privilege of working with Eddie Jones and when you sit down with these guys, they almost know what they want to do every day between now and 21 October 2023, when the Rugby World Cup final takes place. It is a four-year process. Too often athletics thinks in the short term.”', 'Dick also cited neglect of grassroots coaching as being another significant factor in Britain failing to hit its medal target at last year’s world championships in Doha – and said the fact that so many top athletes, including Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Andy Pozzi, Matthew Hudson-Smith and Adam Gemili go abroad to train speaks volumes.', '“There has been a serious malaise in how they look after the coaches,” he said. “I honestly believe that we have world-class coaches and athletes out there. But for these people to fulfil this potential they have to be given the right level of support.”', 'Dick, who joins two other UK Athletics performance directors, Malcolm Arnold and Max Jones, in being critical of the organisation in the past month, said the sport has to go back to basics. “You have to get the culture right, you have to get the processes right and you have to get the people right,” he added. “UK Athletics needs to drill into these three areas and produce the strategy not just for how we will get our medals in 2020 and 2024 but how we will sustain it in the future.”']","Athletics","Sport","2020-02-12",21,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a798ee18fa8e49e2d536a8653dcf8c6ce1d233/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=fd3607dc30d8db5135cb0c462ed325b3","BBC pundits Michael Johnson and Jessica Ennis-Hill broadcast from the Diamond League in London in 2018, one of the elite events.

The club had appealed against the decision by the “investigatory chamber” (IC) of Uefa’s club financial control body to charge City with breaches of FFP, and refer the case to the control body’s “adjudicatory chamber” (AC). The IC’s investigation followed publication of internal City emails by the German magazine Der Spiegel which suggested the club had deceived Uefa in their financial submissions, principally because City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, was funding the club’s sponsorship by the state’s airline, Etihad.', 'City deny any wrongdoing and appealed to Cas against the referral by the IC itself, arguing that it was made “improperly and prematurely”, that it “lacked procedural fairness and due process”, and did not treat City equally with other European clubs.

  ["Virgil van Dijk was a Liverpool bargain at £75m. What would he cost now?","['Defender’s transformative effect outstrips that of De Bruyne, Hazard and others and he would improve any team in the world ']","['Speculative stories are beginning to emerge about Virgil van Dijk’s future, which is no real surprise since – to paraphrase Jane Austen – a 28-year-old defender with the world at his feet must be about to make someone a fortune.', 'In point of fact the Netherlands international would find it difficult to make a step up from Anfield right now, what with Liverpool poised to add the Premier League title to the Champions League crown they hold and may well successfully defend in the next few months.', 'There is no actual need for Van Dijk to go anywhere and quite possibly he won’t, especially if Liverpool are willing to practically double his money by offering an early contract extension, though suggestions that Pep Guardiola might be about to turn up at Juventus next season and wave a cheque for £150m under the Merseyside club’s nose are an amusing way of passing the time until the full fixture programme returns.', 'While that scenario sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the 18 Premier League clubs who would not mind seeing Liverpool and Manchester City hit by a double whammy, it is surely no accident that Van Dijk finds himself the centre of attention. Should the financial giants of Italy or Spain decide to launch an irresistible attack on Premier League talent, who else would they go for?', 'Van Dijk at the moment is probably the Premier League’s most marketable property, one of the very few players who might be worth £150m. It is only two years since eyebrows were raised when Liverpool shelled out £75m for a player who had been hiding in plain sight at Celtic and Southampton, though it was quickly acknowledged that far from going out on a limb Jürgen Klopp and his staff had got themselves a bargain. When one considers how good Liverpool have been since then, the standards that have been set, what has been achieved and the fact that the player is better for the experience and hitting his prime, it does not seem unreasonable for an already high price to have doubled.', 'The feeling with Van Dijk is that a player who can make a £75m price tag seem insignificant can probably do the same for twice the amount.', 'Van Dijk deservedly won the award for PFA player of the season last year, was predictably and somewhat unluckily pipped by Lionel Messi at the Ballon d’Or and – with Liverpool now champions of the world in addition to Europe and most likely England – he is bound to be in the running for all the individual gongs this season. To stand out in the present Liverpool lineup is some feat, especially for a defender, but Van Dijk might just be the most transformative signing made in recent seasons in English football.', 'Although Kevin De Bruyne stands out at Manchester City, he arrived when Manuel Pellegrini was in charge and had to wait a couple of seasons for success. Eden Hazard won European and domestic honours with Chelsea and was unquestionably a standout asset, though it is hard to transform a club that keep changing their managers. The same could be said of Manchester United, where to suggest big-money signings such as Ángel Di María, Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and Alexis Sánchez have not really worked out would be an understatement. Harry Maguire is doing rather better, without providing the instant backbone Van Dijk brought to Liverpool. John Stones appears to be finding it difficult to live up to Guardiola’s expectations at City, and though Aymeric Laporte inspires more confidence his long-term injury this season has cost his club points.', 'Liverpool’s miserly defensive record over the past two seasons does not quite tell its own story, since Alisson arrived half a season after Van Dijk and the goalkeeper not only fixed a problem area but went on to prove a model of consistency. Statistics show Alisson has one of the best shot-stopping ratios around, though they also indicate he faces fewer shots per game than most Premier League goalkeepers.', 'However the credit is apportioned, Liverpool’s goals‑conceded column has become seriously impressive in the past two seasons, particularly for a club that sometimes had a habit of giving goals away cheaply. This season the defence has been breached 15 times in 25 games. For purposes of comparison, second-placed City have conceded 29 times, just over a goal a game, exactly the same as Manchester United. The meanest defence in the Premier League outside Anfield belongs to Sheffield United, with 24 goals against after 26 matches. Last season, though City were champions by a point, they conceded 23 goals to Liverpool’s 22 with Chelsea and Spurs joint next best on 39.', 'When Van Dijk arrived mid‑season Liverpool finished with 38 goals conceded, 10 more than José Mourinho’s Manchester United. The centre-half might not have improved Liverpool’s defensive efficiency all by himself – he obviously has teammates around him to help – though if you had to pick a one-man defence from the options available there is no doubt where most would look. Van Dijk plays with authority, plays every minute, and sets a tremendous example. He has been a wonderful signing, even at a record‑breaking price, and you don’t need to hire Guardiola to spot that. He is the player Liverpool fans would least like to see leave, precisely because he would not only walk into any team in the world but improve them.']","Liverpool","Sport","2020-02-12",19,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5637869d687364255b42fc77ff21157759643d90/0_44_2813_1687/master/2813.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a942165135fcdae2ac7a380c4f5ba8e5","Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk is at the moment probably the most marketable property in the Premier League.

  ["Spurs criticise OED over expanded definition of 'yid'","['North London club says entry referring to its fans’ use of term ‘fails to distinguish context’']","['Tottenham Hotspur have criticised the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) after it expanded its definition of the word “yid” to include a “supporter of or player for” the football club.', 'The word, typically used as an offensive epithet for Jewish people, has been adopted by some Spurs fans as a nickname. Use of the term among Jewish and non-Jewish supporters alike has been the subject of controversy in recent years but has been defended as an attempt to reclaim the term from its racist usage by opposing fans.', 'The OED, has included the word in its latest list of new and updated entries, along with the related term “yiddo”. It said that as well as their racist meanings the words could refer to “a supporter of or player for Tottenham Hotspur football club (traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London).”', 'It said the words’ use was “originally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though also often as a self-designation.”', 'In response, Spurs told the Guardian: “As a club we have never accommodated the use of the Y-word on any club channels or in club stores and have always been clear that our fans (both Jewish and gentile) have never used the term with any intent to cause offence. We find the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of the word misleading given it fails to distinguish context, and welcome their clarification.”', 'The OED said it was bound to “reflect rather than dictate” how language is used, and noted that it had labelled the term as offensive and derogatory.', 'Some critics said the decision to add the definition could give legitimacy to use of a term that they viewed as unequivocally racist.', 'David Baddiel, the writer and comedian who has campaigned in the past against the chanting of the word yid and other antisemitic chants across a variety of football clubs, said the association that the OED had noted was mainly mythical.', '“The vast majority of fans of the club, including those who self-designate as Y-words, are not Jewish and therefore have no right of ‘reclamation’,” he said.', '“What it will weirdly give succour to is: when The Y-Word campaign first started, a Spurs fan said to me, a Jewish person who feels uncomfortable with that word: ‘Fuck off, it’s our word now.’ Can you imagine something similar with any other race hate word? Jews are not even allowed to own their own hate.”', 'Tottenham fans and other Jewish people offered differing views. Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, tweeted: “Not controversial among many of the Jewish Spurs supporters, such as myself, who are proud to be Yiddos.”', 'Last year the north London club carried out a consultation with fans on their use of the Y-word and received more than 23,000 responses. It found that 33% of respondents used the Y-word “regularly” in a footballing context, while 18% who did not use the term in a footballing context considered it offensive, rising to 35% among Jewish respondents.', 'Almost half of all respondents said they would prefer to see supporters chant the Y-word less or stop using it altogether. The club, which has been organising focus groups to explore the issue further, said at the time that sentiment around the term appeared to be changing among the fanbase. “There is a recognition of the offence the Y-word can cause and that a footballing context alone does not justify its continued use,” it said.', 'Another Jewish Spurs fan, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian he was surprised at the number of Jewish fans coming out against use of the word. “When do I feel uncomfortable being Jewish at Spurs? When Chelsea and West Ham fans make gas chamber noises. Not when fans of the club that embraced Jewish immigrants chant a word rooted in that history,” he said.', 'The new OED entry on the word refers to mentions made in news reports dating back to 1972 and 1982 of antisemitic chants during clashes between rival football supporters.', 'The OED said it had chosen to cover this sense of the term now because it was revising and updating words from this part of the alphabet. ', '“As a historical dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary records the usage and development of words in the English language,” a spokesperson said. “We reflect rather than dictate how language is used, which means we include words which may be considered sensitive and derogatory. These are always labelled as such.', '“The entry for ‘yiddo’ is labelled as offensive and derogatory and our reference to Tottenham Hotspur is a reflection of the evidence for the word. As we state at the closely related word ‘yid’, Tottenham Hotspur football club is traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London, and the term is sometimes used as a self-designation by some Tottenham fans. We will ensure the context for this connection is very clear in both definitions.” ']","Tottenham Hotspur","Sport","2020-02-12",18.1,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6a104ede93ad537ebdbd1a73e375fb82312646/200_0_3608_2164/master/3608.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d9863b4584bc5ad78a486b9d5506fdfe","A Spurs banner at Wembley in 2015.

Her starting date is yet to be confirmed but she will join a sport that has lost two chairs, two chief executives and its performance director Neil Black in the last 17 months – and this week also became the subject of a major UK Sport review.', 'That review could well lead to job losses and a cut in lottery funding, and to make matters potentially worse UK Athletics will also soon announce the findings of a separate independent review into its relationship with the US coach Alberto Salazar, who received a four-year ban for doping last year.', 'There are also questions over the long-term state of the organisation’s finances, with the Guardian revealing on Wednesday that the BBC was willing to pay only a fraction of the £3m-a-year fee it currently pays the organisation for live coverage.', 'Adams will become the organisation’s first full-time chief executive since Niels de Vos left in 2018. The post was originally due to be filled by Zara Hyde Peters in December but she stepped down before starting after questions were raised over whether she allowed her husband to coach at a local athletics club after he had an “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.', 'Adams is credited with professionalising netball by bringing in major sponsors and television agreements while growing grassroots participation during her 10 years in the sport – which included hosting the most successful World Cup in the sport’s history in 2019.', 'After leaving England Netball last August she became the first chief commercial officer at the London Legacy Development Corporation, the organisation responsible for the regeneration of east London and delivering legacy after the London 2012 Olympics.', 'When Adams starts her new role there will be a game of musical chairs at UK Athletics with Clark – who took over from Richard Bowker last year – stepping down as chair to take on the development of a commercial plan for track and field. Nic Coward, who took over as acting chief executive only last month, will become chair for the rest of 2020.', '“The role of chair for UKA clearly now requires a huge time commitment during this crucial period,” said Clark, who was said by insiders to be surprised that a job that was supposed to take up five days a month was consuming far more of his time. “My other commitments to regulated businesses and public sector organisations have significantly increased since commencing the role and I have to concede that I cannot give it the time commitment it deserves right now.', '“However, I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue working with UK Athletics on the commercial strategy and Joanna’s appointment and her track record of success in not only sports governance but also commercial, marketing and competition structures means we have excellent leadership to take the sport in a positive future direction.”', 'Clark added: “Nic has already made a very positive impact and retaining his expertise for this transition period was an important consideration when the board debated the changes we needed to make. The focus now has to be the future and how we will apply the learnings and best practice from the ongoing reviews and ensure the sport has a hugely successful future.”']","Athletics","Sport","2020-02-14",0.59,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1a033c83134f6865fac0682e4c8c026dce61e6/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=77cab48b162671ec647fb1f8ab862aa1","Chris Clark said he does not have the time to be chairman of UK Athletics while Joanna Adams will be tasked with rebuilding the organisation’s battered reputation in her role as chief executive.

Both say they intend to stay at Saracens next season but do not yet know to what extent relegation to the Championship will affect their careers.', 'As things stand both George and Itoje, currently on England duty, are committed to remaining but are unsure how many of their teammates will be able to do likewise. “We haven’t got all the answers yet,” George said. “It’s a difficult one. We are 80 or 90% of the way to knowing what’s going on but there’s still a few bits to work out. I won’t lie to you, there is a lot going on. We are obviously feeling for the boys at the club who are having to deal with it day in, day out. Coming away into [England’s] camp was almost a relief … we’ve something else to focus on.”', 'Worcester’s Michael Fatialofa has begun a process of rehabilitation having spent three weeks in intensive care recovering from the serious spinal cord injury he sustained playing against Saracens in January.', 'Fatialofa posted a video on Instagram yesterday showing him moving his toes and lifting his legs while taking tentative steps at a specialist spinal clinic at the Royal Buckinghamshire hospital in Aylesbury. The 27-year-old has been transferred there after spending four weeks at London’s St Mary’s hospital, the majority of which was in intensive care.', 'Fatialofa was injured in a collision during the defeat at Saracens on 4 January which held up play for 15 minutes while the lock received treatment.\\xa0', '“Six weeks deep. Doctors didn’t know me,” Fatialofa wrote on Instagram. “Could be years of grinding ahead but determined to get out of this chair.”', 'Spectators who attend Worcester’s Premiership game against Bath at Sixways tomorrow will be given a leaflet asking them to\\xa0donate to the JustGiving page that\\xa0has been set up to support Fatialofa and his wife Tatiana. Saracens have also pledged to donate £1,000 for every try they score at home to Sale. Sachin Nakrani', 'Itoje also revealed it “felt like an invasion of privacy” when the full independent report detailing his image rights arrangements with the club was leaked, making public a significant amount of joint investment detail. “It wasn’t ideal, to be honest. It felt like an invasion of privacy but some things are out of your control.', '“When I entered into [the agreements] they were all – to my knowledge, based on anything I got told – above board. There wasn’t even the slightest thought of it being not allowed by the salary cap manager. Obviously the situation is very different now. It is very clear that whatever you do, you have to get it checked.”', 'Itoje, though, is not so keen for players’ salaries to become a routine matter of public record in future – “I wouldn’t want anybody or everybody knowing exactly what I’m earning … I don’t think there’s a genuine need for that” – and would clearly prefer the furore to go away. “No one at the club wanted this to happen and no one at the club envisaged this would happen. So I don’t want to sit here and say: ‘It was this person’s fault or that person’s fault.’ I’m not here to point fingers.”', 'George was more forthcoming on the emotions he has experienced since Saracens’ original fine and points deduction were announced in early November. “It’s difficult to put one word on it. [At first] you’re angry or upset but find a way to find the positives. Then something else happens and you go through it again. We’ll be challenged this season more than we’ve ever been and probably again next season. We’ve got to make sure that we fight to keep the club afloat really.', '“I guess we as players feel a responsibility to pay back what the club have given us. They have shown a huge amount of loyalty to me, as well as remorse in terms of what they have done. That is appreciated. I don’t feel let down. The opportunities that Nigel Wray has given to me as a person from the age of 17 … he has invested so much time and love in me so I will be for ever grateful for that.”', 'Quite how easy the club’s senior players will find it to juggle Championship rugby with retaining their England starting places under Eddie Jones while also pushing their Lions claims remains to be seen.', 'George, now 29, is trying to look on the bright side – “It might be an opportunity to rest a little bit more which you don’t really get at this stage of your career” – but not everyone’s circumstances are the same.', '“The conversations are ongoing with Eddie and [Saracens’ director of rugby] Mark McCall,” George said. “I think it will be different for each individual but I want to stay at the club and be part of the transition going forward. I didn’t get any offers from France; maybe they aren’t interested. But I haven’t been looking.', '“For me the pinnacle of my career is playing for England and further, so for that to be the case I need to be in the country. There is talk of playing pretty competitive games in South Africa and talk of actually playing against South Africa. Games like that will be essential.”', 'England, meanwhile, are still hopeful that Manu Tuilagi may be fit to feature against Ireland on Sunday week having been injured in the first half against France and sat out the Scotland game with a sore groin.

That happened during the World Cup when he failed two head injury assessments in 11 days following collisions against Australia and Fiji.', 'It was a tournament run by World Rugby whose rules stipulate that any player suffering two concussions in a year must be independently assessed after passing the return to play protocols, but there is no obligation on teams to do so in the Six Nations.', 'The Welsh Rugby Union’s national medical manager Prav Mathema insists on independent consultation after a repeat concussion and in recent years Leigh Halfpenny, George North and Patchell have all had extended layoffs. Biggar is in the care of Northampton this week under Premiership regulations because there are no Six Nations matches, but he will not be considered for Sunday’s home match against Bristol.', '“Dan is doing the normal return to play protocols,” said Wales’s assistant coach, Neil Jenkins. “That takes a bit of time but he is recovering well and we hope he will be OK for next week. The World Cup was a concern in terms of the heavy knocks that he had, but I don’t think Saturday was as bad as those.', '“A head injury assessment is still something that you’ve got to do and the right decision was made [to leave him out against Ireland]. He is a tough old player, as you could see on Saturday because trying to get him off was an issue. He will do everything to be ready to face France.”', 'Wales have not brought another fly-half into the squad even though they are down to two in Biggar and his replacement in Dublin, Cardiff’s Jarrod Evans, although Patchell is likely to be recalled if he makes his return for Scarlets on the weekend of the France match.', 'Wales’s wing Josh Adams, who scored a hat-trick of tries against Italy in the opening round, will be fit to face France. He was replaced after 25 minutes against Ireland after being unable to run off a knock on his hip, but he is expected to resume training at the end of the week.', '“Josh is recovering and going through his treatment,” Jenkins said. “He is one of our leading lights who was outstanding in the World Cup and in the two games so far up until his injury. Josh is spending most of the time with the medics and will train when he is ready to go.', '“We have reviewed the Ireland game and though we were under the pump at times, it was a match we would have won but for errors. We know how strong France are: they would probably have beaten us in the World Cup but for a sending off.

Madley will officiate non-league matches for the remainder of this season.', '“Like any referee I have the desire to perform at my best and to achieve the best I can,” Madley wrote on his blog, therefereesword. “I know how hard that road is to referee at the top but I have the desire and passion to work hard to achieve my potential whatever that may be. I still have dreams that I thought were dead but for me they are now very much alive.”', 'Madley was removed from the Premier League list of referees in August 2018 after a video of him mocking a disabled man was shared with his employer, the PGMOL. Last year he described it as a private joke taken out of context but accepted it was “badly misjudged”.', '“I have never tried to excuse my actions of 2018,” Madley wrote in his latest post. “I have never looked to blame anyone but myself. I am not proud of my actions in 2018 and I have learned from this and feel I am a better and stronger person for it.', '“PGMOL dealt with what they considered a discriminatory act in the strongest way. There can be no criticism for that and I have never sought to do anything other than respect the decision and to learn from it as a person. I can only thank them for having the ability to forgive, recognise that one naive moment does not define a person and offer me a second chance to do what I love to do.”', 'Since losing his job Madley has refereed in Norway, where he has been living.

I have no clue how far we can go but there’s no need to think about it yet because at the moment all we need to concentrate on is Atlético on Tuesday.”', 'Having been to the last two finals many believe Liverpool are the strongest team left in the competition, certainly the one most feared by opponents, though Klopp is happy just to be alive and fighting.', '“I have no clue if we can win the Champions League again but we should be ready to go for it,” he said. “What I know and what we showed last year is that we can beat the best. It doesn’t mean we will, it just means we can, and that is the only thing I have to know. There are so many strong teams out there you have to ready for the fight, then it’s about luck in certain moments to win anything. In the end the quality within a squad is not always the biggest difference; it’s more about who can find the right mood, show the most desire, be decisive in the right moment. And luck. To win anything you will need that for sure.”', 'Before setting off for Spain the league leaders face a trip to Norwich on Saturday to take on the team bottom of the table. “People think it will be easy, but that is not how this league is,” Klopp said. “We have to make sure we don’t go there thinking it will be easy. We have been preparing all week – and it is the dream of every manager to have a full week to prepare for a match – as if this game is going to be the most important of our lives.”', 'Norwich lost 4-1 at Anfield on the first day of the season but Klopp was still impressed. “They scored a goal and could have had more,” he said. “They stuck to their principles when they went behind, and that is what they are still doing in the Premier League. Norwich seem capable of causing most teams they play against real problems yet they find it hard to win enough games. That’s how strong this league is.

The former Saracens chairman also covered renovations costs.', 'Although no players were at fault for the breaches, the fallout for Saracens has been catastrophic. Initially they were handed a 35-point deduction but having refused to a mid-season audit and acknowledged they will be over the salary cap this season, Premiership Rugby hit them with another 70-point deduction which rubber-stamped their relegation.', 'Jamie George became the first of their England internationals to confirm he intends to stay at the club next season with Mako Vunipola revealing he is in negotiations over following suit. A number of their younger players on the fringes of international setups are set to leave however, to avoid spending a year in the Championship, which has just been hit by funding cuts of 50% for next season.', 'Vunipola however, was adamant that if Wray approached him over a potential co-investment again he would accept in order to secure his future once his career is over. The 29-year-old said: “No regrets at all. If I had the choice to do it again, I would do it again knowing what has happened.', '“That is no slight at not caring about what has happened to the club, but more the fact that I know rugby is important, but our careers are short and I want to look ahead a bit.

For us as rugby players, we deal with it every day and it is something that we are used to. But when people are saying stuff about you and you have family who care about you, it affects them.', '“When we first got told that we had minus 35 was a low moment. And then when they announced we were definitely relegated was probably the lowest. Because as a team, when we had that first fine we understood it and thought: ‘We can get after this’.

In Durban he was brief but devastating with the bat, defibrilating England’s innings from a standing start. An hour into this second match England had stalled a little at 125 for five off 15 overs batting first. Joe Denly had lasted two balls in his specialist all-purpose filler role.', 'Enter the man they said couldn’t start against pace. At Kingsmead Moeen set off like a bullet train. His second delivery, a cutter from Andile Phehlukwayo, was clumped over long-on. Beuran Hendricks was lifted over deep square leg then pinged over long-off.

First he produced a counter-balance to Moeen’s barrage; by the time he was out for 65 off 22 balls, it was one of the most extraordinary innings you could hope to see in this format.', 'Still running hot, Moeen took the new ball in the chase. His first over went for five. At which point De Kock switched to his most elegantly murderous mode. Moeen’s third over went for 20 as De Kock lifted and cuffed and monstered him for three huge sixes.', 'Next De Kock took the long handle to Curran. He went to his fifty off 17 balls, the fastest by a South African. On 69 without loss after six, then 102 off 10, they were hurtling toward England’s score. De Kock was finally out mis-hitting a near waist-high full toss from Mark Wood to the midwicket fence. T20 isn’t always an elegant game, but this was the most beautiful display of batting violence.', 'Earlier South Africa had won the toss and bowled on a powder blue evening. England picked an unchanged XI, as Dawid Malan continued his long walk to maybe getting a game somewhere on tour. Jos Buttler opened again, still dining out on those slightly over-valued IPL half-centuries.', 'Early on Ngidi nipped one away and Buttler nicked it. He now has 78 in his last five innings as England’s T20 opener. No matter though. Recent history suggests England will just keep playing him there until the opportunity to be proved right presents itself.', 'At other end Jason Roy lifted Fortuin’s fifth ball over mid-off for six like a man clearing his throat. England were 55 for one at the end of the sixth over. That adrenal finish set up the game.', 'Enter De Kock, half an hour of violence, and a dismissal that left South Africa needing 113 off 12 overs. Mark Wood bowled quickly to remove Temba Bavuma. South Africa needed 82 off 45 as England turned the screw, Chris Jordan bowling with skill and pace as the chase began to bite.', 'The lower order was left chasing 45 off 18, but Wood’s final over went for 19. South Africa needed 15 off the last. Curran got away with one slower ball but saw his second clubbed for a huge six by Dwaine Pretorius. Curran struck back, producing fine yorkers to get rid of Pretorius, then dismiss the desperate Fortuin. England stay alive, just.']","England in South Africa 2019-20","Sport","2020-02-14",20.25,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2c005bb7b96af015a1becbfe5549c4cb128eb0/0_138_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=092d302bcd17556603447eb27ce2ee71","Tom Curran celebrates the final wicket after he bowled three fine yorkers as England snatched T20 victory over South Africa.

  ["How 'leaked' emails and invoices led to Manchester City's ban from Europe","['Uefa investigation was greeted with scorn and denial by the club, but has culminated in a guilty verdict ']","['Throughout the startling “leaks” of Manchester City’s internal emails in the German magazine Der Spiegel, and the resulting investigation by Uefa which led ultimately to Friday’s guilty finding and two-season Champions League ban and €30m (£25m) fine, City’s response has been uniform: scorn, outrage, denial.', 'The emails, splashed by Spiegel with evident relish across a series of exposés, punched into City’s expertly and expensively created modern image in three broad areas relating to Uefa’s financial fair play rules, which were introduced in 2011 to deter clubs from overspending.', 'First, and most damaging, were emails and accounting documents which appeared to show that City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour, of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, was mostly funding the huge, £67.5m annual sponsorship of the club’s shirt, stadium and academy by his country’s airline, Etihad. That created a perception that the Abu Dhabi hierarchy, in their drive to mega-spend on City attaining elite status while somehow complying with FFP rules, had deceived Uefa in their financial submissions. This serious trouble for City sprang from a tiny number of emails, a fraction of the documentary dump provided to Spiegel by its source, Rui Pinto, a Portuguese national now charged in his home country with 147 criminal offences including computer hacking, all of which he denies.', 'FFP rules limit the amount of money owners can put in to bankroll losses, encouraging top-division European clubs not to overspend on players’ wages and transfer fees and risk falling into financial crisis, and to spend within their revenues. Mansour started financing mega-losses on player signings and wages after his 2008 takeover and City had scrambled, particularly following the introduction of FFP in 2011, to turbo-boost their revenues with large sponsorships from Abu Dhabi companies.', 'One of the emails, from City’s then chief financial officer, Jorge Chumillas, headed “Cashflow”, stated that Mansour’s own company vehicle, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), would be paying £57m as a “contribution to 13/14 sponsorship fee”, while only £8m was Etihad’s “direct contribution”. Then Chumillas sent invoices for Etihad, internally to the City executives Ferran Soriano and Simon Pearce, stating that for 2015-16, the Etihad sponsorship was £67.5m, of which “£8m should be funded directly by Etihad and £59.5 [sic] by ADUG”.', 'Following the Spiegel coverage, Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) investigatory chamber (IC) finally announced last March that it was launching an investigation, and City responded by saying they would comfortably prove that the accusations were “entirely false”. The IC, a panel of grandees chaired by Yves Leterme, a former Belgian prime minister, was clearly not convinced, however, after its inquiry which involved two days of hearings, and it charged the club in May. City responded with scorn, accusing the IC of ignoring “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence”, said the decision was the result of “mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process”, and in effect accused the IC of being biased, running “a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process”.', 'City expressed huge outrage that the IC’s pending decision to charge was leaked two days early – which was indeed embarrassing to Uefa – although the truth is that throughout the process, very little detail has leaked. The fact that the IC did charge City, though, made it self-evident that the hierarchy’s explanations, and whatever documentation they did provide, did not satisfy the IC that questions raised by the club’s own internal communications had been irrefutably answered.', 'The IC can reasonably have expected City to produce, for example, the internal replies to Chumillas’s stunning emails, which perhaps would show he had been corrected, or that in context it could be shown that it was simply, “irrefutably”, not the case that ADUG was funding the Etihad sponsorship. Instead, the IC clearly decided that the allegations had not been refuted, and sent them for determination by Uefa’s CFCB adjudicatory chamber, which is chaired by José Narciso da Cunha Rodrigues, a former general prosecutor in Portugal and judge at the European Court of Justice, and includes a leading British barrister, Charles Flint QC.', 'These public responses after the charges were laid were consistent with the second element exposed by the emails: how hostile and confrontational City had been to Uefa, and to FFP itself, throughout the process of compliance – at times distastefully so. FFP applied to all top-flight clubs across Europe competing in the Champions and Europa Leagues, seeking to encourage long-term football development and dampen player wage inflation, with detailed new regulations and a sophisticated reporting system developed by Uefa with blue-chip accountants.', 'City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, was never a major supporter of FFP, seeing it as a restraint of Mansour’s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in, but the emails showed the resistance went further. It seemed as if the hierarchy had almost taken it personally, feeling that this whole FFP system was a protectionist move to stop Mansour’s extravagance challenging the established superclubs. Perhaps there was something of that in the support for FFP given by Bayern Munich and the German clubs in particular, but they were trying to maintain financial sustainability in the Bundesliga where most clubs are still ultimately controlled by supporters. They and many other clubs in Europe felt it was alien to the game’s traditions for Gulf sovereign investors to buy clubs and spend their way to success.', 'City perceived their plans for rapid accession to the Champions League elite were challenged by FFP, and persistently threatened a legal challenge. The club’s inhouse lawyer Simon Cliff wrote in one of the published emails that Mubarak had told Gianni Infantino, then Uefa’s general secretary, that he would not accept a financial sanction for exceeding the permitted €45m loss in 2012 and 2013, and said: “He would rather spend 30 million on the 50 best lawyers in the world to sue [Uefa] for the next 10 years.”', 'In 2014, the IC determined that City had a deficit of €180m over that two-year period, vastly in excess of the €45m permitted, and in May that year agreed a settlement which some at Uefa believed was too lenient. A day before that, the former chair of the IC, Jean-Luc Dehaene, a distinguished former prime minister of Belgium and senior EU politician, died aged 73, survived by his wife of 49 years and their four children. Spiegel quoted Cliff’s reaction to this news in an internal email, referring to the membership of the IC: “1 down, 6 to go.”', 'Since its exposure, no one from City has apologised for that email, apparently due to the stance that the emails were hacked, so the contents, however unfortunate, are not to be acknowledged.', 'The third element revealed in the leaked material did not mostly form part of the IC’s investigation, having been dealt with as part of the 2014 settlement, but it revealed the extent to which City had engaged in some creative accounting to persuade Uefa it had complied with the new “break-even” rules. Most of these restructurings had been spotted and disallowed by the IC and the consultants, PwC, it sent to peer into the detail.', 'Following the publication of the leaks, City refused to respond at all to Spiegel, the rest of the media and to Uefa, until the IC, having initially responded uncertainly, decided it had to investigate. City denounced the use of the emails as “out-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen”, and alleged there was an “organised and clear attempt to damage the club’s reputation”.', 'Spiegel anonymised its source as “John” in the coverage, and quoted him denying that he acquired his vaults of 70m documents from football strongholds as a result of hacks, saying he had good contacts. Within weeks he was identified as Pinto, now on remand in a Lisbon prison awaiting trial, charged with alleged hacking and other offences, although only against Portuguese clubs and institutions, not City or Uefa. Pinto acknowledged to Spiegel in December that there was hacking software on his computer, and “some of my acts may be considered illegal”, but denied he had committed criminal offences, saying: “I don’t consider myself a hacker.”', 'But for people, or organisations such as City, who find they are victims of leaks, or hacks, there is a deeply uncomfortable contradiction to the consequences. However justified their outrage, if the documents reveal possible wrongdoing, then regulators or governing bodies are duty bound to investigate.', 'Now, after a review of the evidence and a hearing last month, the AC has decided like the IC, that City’s hierarchy have been damned by their own internal material. For all the fury and belligerence of their response, the club have not explained away the impression and apparent evidence that they deceived European football’s governing body with their financial submissions, even while they were spending huge money to star in its glittering competition.']","Manchester City","Sport","2020-02-14",18.47,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e647154c5750245af7e848d5a309a901d507ccd2/314_135_2525_1515/master/2525.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=967c0b9c7e8c5f6bd99d558a291e90cb","Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne, Benjamin Mendy and Raheem Sterling reflect on last season’s dramatic Champions League defeat by Tottenham.

If the appeal is still going on when next season’s Champions League starts, City will be able to compete and, if Cas upholds the ban, it will start in 2021-22.', 'City were found guilty by Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) of having falsely inflated their sponsorship revenues, when they made submissions for the FFP compliance process. The guilty finding follows an investigation sparked by the publication of “leaked” emails and documents by the German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018.', 'The “leaked” emails and documents appeared to show that City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, was mostly funding the huge, £67.5m annual sponsorship of the City shirt, stadium and academy by his country’s airline, Etihad. One of the leaked emails suggested that only £8m of that sponsorship in 2015-16 was funded directly by Etihad and the rest was coming from Mansour’s own company vehicle for the ownership of City, the Abu Dhabi United Group.', 'Manchester City alleged in their statement that the outcome had been prejudged from the beginning, and that the process was “flawed and consistently leaked”, saying the club was “disappointed but not surprised” by the decision. City said they will appeal against the ban and fine “at the earliest opportunity” at CAS. “The club has always anticipated the ultimate need to seek out an independent body and process to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence in support of its position,” the statement read.', '“Simply put, this is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa. With this prejudicial process now over, the club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the earliest opportunity.” A City source confirmed that Mansour remains fully committed to the club.', 'Uefa said in its statement: “The Adjudicatory Chamber, having considered all the evidence, has found that Manchester City committed serious breaches of the Uefa Financial Fair Play Regulations by overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016.', '“The Adjudicatory Chamber has also found that in breach of the regulations the club failed to cooperate in the investigation of this case by the CFCB.”', 'FFP, introduced in 2011 with the aim of encouraging football clubs across Europe not to overspend on players’ wages, restricts the amount club owners can put in to cover losses. Sponsorships boost revenues and therefore the amount clubs have to spend under FFP, so the perception that Mansour himself was funding the Etihad deal led to the serious allegation that City had deceived Uefa’s CFCB, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with FFP.', 'City have denied wrongdoing throughout and denounced the Spiegel coverage as based on “hacked or stolen” materials taken out of context. Spiegel anonymised its source as “John”, who was quoted as saying he had not hacked computers to obtain the emails.', 'Shortly after their publication, he was identified as a Portuguese national, Rui Pinto, who has now been charged in Portugal with 147 criminal offences, including hacking and other cybercrimes, which he denies. The charges relate only to Portuguese football clubs and other organisations, not to the “leaks” of City’s or Uefa’s emails.', 'When City were charged last May, they said that they had been subjected to a “hostile” process which ignored “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence”.']","Manchester City","Sport","2020-02-14",18.27,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68464a134c62dcd6c218295cde28053bd6c0441/0_273_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7c7656d1e5762898e5498c89d711acce","Manchester City have been banned from the Champions League by Uefa.

  ["Why doesn't boxing care about gender-based violence?","['The Gervonta Davis video is the latest example of the boxing industry’s structural inadequacy and self-serving indifference when it comes to holding abusers of women to account']","['Earlier this month Gervonta Davis, the World Boxing Association’s lightweight champion and one of America’s most prodigiously gifted young athletes, was shown in a widely circulated video choking the mother of his child in front of hundreds of people at a charity basketball game on the campus of the University of Miami.', 'The short clip of the incident, which has been viewed more than 7.6m times, is stomach-turning. But maybe not for reasons that are immediately obvious on first viewing.', 'Watch it again and look at the shock on the faces of the young girls in the foreground as the scene abruptly ignites. Look at the man seated to the woman’s left who literally stands up and walks away when Davis yanks her from her chair. Look at the reaction of the nearby security guard twice Davis’s size who hardly bats an eye, like this is a common occurrence, as he allows the boxer to close his hands around the woman’s throat before all but clearing a path for him to drag her into the darkness beneath the stands.', 'Had Davis been putting his hands on a man in the same way, you can bet that a dozen other men would have flailed into the situation to break things up. But it was a woman. And it was allowed to happen while a whole group of children watched. Ultimately, no one but Davis himself can be blamed for what unfolded, but the optics of indifference on display in those 14 seconds paint a chilling picture.', 'Davis immediately took to social media for damage control as the video rapidly spread, claiming “I never once hit her” on his since-wiped Instagram, only to voluntarily surrender to Coral Gables police three days later on a charge of simple battery domestic violence. An arrest report acquired by the Guardian stated that a surveillance camera in the room they disappeared into “shows a partial view of the defendant pulling his arm back and then forward towards the victim, which is consistent with a strike to the face where the victim sustained injuries to her lip and left jaw”.', 'You’re reading about this particular case only because Davis is a famous athlete. He came up the hard way from abject poverty in west Baltimore, learned to box under the trainer who inspired the Cutty character in The Wire and excelled to become the sport’s second-youngest world champion at just 22 years old. He is the type of homegrown property with a compelling backstory and crowd-pleasing style that makes US television executives salivate. Under Armour saw enough in Davis to sign him to a sponsorship deal and plaster billboards with his image, a rare mainstream breakthrough in a sport that’s increasingly been ignored by major brands. (An Under Armour spokesperson told the Guardian the company parted ways with Davis “a while ago” but did not respond to follow-up questions about the terms of the contract and the reason it ended.)', 'But the story here is not Gervonta Davis. That’s a copout that allows us to otherize a single young black man who participates in a sport broadly associated with violence, as if gender-based abuse isn’t happening all around us, in every culture and in every segment of society, with countless survivors either afraid to report it or without the benefit of video footage to back up their claims. This is not about boxers being violent. Or athletes who participate in violent sports being violent. Or even that sportspeople from distressed backgrounds are violent.', 'Men are violent. White and black, rich and poor. Impunity for violence against women is as universal an issue as issues get. And everyone must call it out when they see it because the longer we keep looking the other way, the more it’s bound to keep happening. And this is where boxing as an industry, specifically, is failing. The sport has demonstrated one time after another that it is structurally ill-equipped to hold transgressors like Davis responsible and deliver legitimate repercussions for their actions.', 'Athletes in America’s most popular sports like football, basketball and baseball are (at last) being punished harshly for gender-based violence, through suspensions or the loss of endorsement deals, but we have yet to see boxers face the same consequences. On some level, putting aside the normalization of the abuse of women in our society, it fits into the framework of how the broader public understands a sport like boxing. Violence begets violence, it’s thought. But that, too, is a fallacy.', 'The problem is inherent in the sport’s decentralized power structure. Boxers are independent contractors and the absence of a central governing body means any form of discipline would have to come from the networks and the promoters, who have a direct financial stake in a fighter’s public profile and ability to generate revenue. Any of the individual athletic commissions which sanction the sport on a state-by-state basis could put their foot down and deny a fighter the license required to fight in their boundaries, but there will always be another state waiting with open arms to deliver a big-ticket event, and the economic impact it brings, to their backyard. Same goes for the networks, in this case Showtime, which has made no small investment in broadcasting Davis’s past seven fights either on premium cable or on pay-per-view. They have declined to comment on the matter but their position doesn’t require any extraordinary insight to divine. They are a publicly traded company answerable to their shareholders, fully aware their rivals in a space where market share is a zero-sum game would be falling over themselves to sign Davis if they dropped him. They want to be responsible, but they also want to remain in business.', 'Truth is, the same power brokers who dress boxing up as the biggest sport in the world for a couple of nights a year are more than content to have it spend the rest of the calendar in the shadows, where incidents like these barely make the news and can be marginalized during the next money-spinning promotion. So once the commission has passed off the responsibility to the network, and the network has passed it off to the consumer, the entire operation is dependent on the public’s indifference when it comes to violence against women.', 'There is simply no existing incentive to take a strong disciplinary stand when time and again it’s been proven that any stigma resultant from instances of gender-based violence does nothing to compromise a fighter’s market value. In fact, many boxers have been rewarded in the immediate aftermath, essentially profiting off their notoriety. Mike Tyson’s first fight back after serving a three-year prison sentence on a rape conviction, despite being a glorified exhibition, remains one of the highest-grossing events in the sport’s history. And Floyd Mayweather Jr, who mentored Davis for years, was handed a quarter-billion dollar contract from Showtime and CBS only months after serving a 60-day sentence in a Nevada county jail for a domestic abuse conviction in 2013. Maddeningly, to promote his first fight under the record-smashing deal, Showtime infamously televised an hour-long infomercial, produced by Mayweather, which reframed his incarceration as an obstacle to be overcome on the comeback trail.', 'Boxers, contrary to the public perception, are not more prone to violence outside the ring than anyone else. Putting aside the many studies that show athletes in violent sports commit gender-based violence at a lower rate than the general population (since rates are unreliable and essentially meaningless due to underreporting); anecdotally, any boxing lifer will tell you the sport does far more to drill violence out of adolescents who come from at-risk circumstances than it’s done to exacerbate aggressive tendencies, teaching its practitioners to control and channel extreme impulses toward productive ends.', 'Which is to say I am pretty sure what happened that night in Coral Gables has nothing to do with Gervonta Davis being a boxer. But until the machine which profits from him can find a way to place something between Davis and the next big payday besides an Instagram mea culpa, there’s no incentive for him to assume responsibility for his behavior and the cycle is bound to repeat itself. The only question is whether anyone with a seat at the table will care. No one but Davis himself can be directly blamed for what happened in that gym, just as no single party is entirely responsible for an industry’s inability to hold abusers to account. But as is clear in those 14 seconds, the failure of the whole collective is impossible to deny.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-02-14",8,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef972404baa9b866d5f44099294a17f11de9e09/0_155_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=401fd7c03e83aa2c34798f018814b2cf","Baltimore’s Gervonta Davis, right, a world champion in two weight classes at 25 years old, is one of America’s most talented young boxers.

He gave a measured answer, saying he would first discuss with his team whether they would make a gesture and how best to do that rather than making off-the-cuff commitments.', '“It will be discussed amongst ourselves\\xa0and we’ll decide how we’ll go forward as a team,” Holder said. “But I don’t want to sit here and speak for the other members without consulting them.\\xa0I think that would be wrong.\\xa0', '“I just want to make sure\\xa0that\\xa0whatever we do – if we do anything – is done the right way. And if we do decide to show some sort of solidarity we make sure that everybody is on the same page. For me the greatest thing at the end of the day is unity. We must all come together, there must be equality across the world.”', 'Before diverting to the peculiarities of this\\xa0cricket\\xa0tour Holder also spoke about the need for education. “A\\xa0lot of people live\\xa0but\\xa0do\\xa0not know exactly what goes on around them and this is the perfect time to educate yourselves and make a change.”\\xa0', 'Holder has always been party to the discussions with the England and Wales Cricket Board around what a possible tour to England might look like. “We obviously had our internal discussions with Cricket West Indies as well and we just tried to gather as much information as possible,” he said. “Having that information was crucial to be able to then answer any questions from the players.\\xa0At no point in time\\xa0did\\xa0we force anybody to come. Everybody had their free will.”\\xa0', 'In the end, three players – Darren Bravo, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul – chose not to be available.', 'First impressions upon landing in England were favourable. “To be honest, I feel pretty safe,” Holder said. “I must commend the ECB; they’ve been outstanding. We had a chartered airline and arriving here yesterday in Manchester was pretty smooth. We just transferred directly from the plane through\\xa0the\\xa0VIP arrival hall and then from there straight on to the buses directly to the hotel.”', 'The players will be locked away throughout their stay but Holder explained that they have prepared for that and it is not so different from some\\xa0of their\\xa0tours to the subcontinent. And he wants to play some cricket.\\xa0', '“Oh man, I’ve been sat at home for the last couple of months doing nothing. So to be getting some cricket, doing something I love,\\xa0is great\\xa0and I think most of the guys feel the same way. We haven’t had competitive cricket for a while.

  ["AFL enters unknown territory with much up in the air as season restarts","['The resumption of the 2020 season has given the competition a degree of certainty but also thrown up many questions']","['Nobody remembers who came second. It is a maxim that is in line for a searching examination when the 2020 AFL premiership season resumes on Thursday night at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the rugby league stronghold states of New South Wales and Queensland, the consensus is that the NRL won the race by restarting its season sooner than any code in the country. Ask those further south and out west, and there never was a race at all.', 'The NRL did beat the AFL to the punch, however, returning two weeks prior and raking in the enormous TV ratings that come with the “clear air” that the ARLC chairman Peter V’landys so craves. In slashing its way through political red tape, the NRL also prised open a conversation about the return of professional sport that might otherwise have been some time coming. For this, the AFL can be grateful.', 'But while V’landys drew plaudits from those within rugby league for getting the job done, the applause was matched by censure in the wider community that condemned a man for apparently putting sport ahead of the public interest.\\xa0', 'And this is reflected in the rhetoric. Where V’landys moved ahead without the initial buy-in of government and health officials, the AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan engaged in working relationships with states and territories. Where V’landys likes to fan the flames – “I do like annoying the Victorians … at times I’ve looked at them and had a giggle” – McLachlan plumps for diplomacy. “I don’t pay any attention,” he said this week on Fox Footy. “For those who want to compete, let’s see where we are at the end of the year and what the scoreboard looks like. For the rest like me who don’t really care, good luck to all sports to get through this.”', 'Although we can look ahead with a degree of certainty, there is still much up in the air.', 'Quarantine protocols and border restrictions remain varied across the country, leading the AFL to release its revised fixtures in blocks of four rounds. The AFL might have attracted widespread praise for getting its season away, but cries of inequity continue to be heard over the competitive disadvantage facing the four clubs from Western Australia and South Australia to be domiciled in hubs on the Gold Coast.', 'A brouhaha is in the offing over this, with the players’ association lobbying the AFL for teams to spend no more than four weeks away from home. Premiership fancies West Coast are unsurprisingly strong advocates of this, as well as a make-good run of home games to end the season.', 'As things stand, when the siren sounds to commence the clash between Richmond and Collingwood, the AFL remains without a broadcast rights deal for this 17-round season. Even the grand final can be no more than be pencilled in for 24 October, McLachlan conceding the “last weekend in December” is still an option if further interruptions are brought on by the pandemic.', 'So there are twists and turns still to be negotiated before the season is done. But now, having scaled the molehill of round one, the AFL’s 18 clubs stand at the foot of a mountain, the summit of which remains shrouded by the fog of Covid-19. For months the narrative has centred on containment, isolation and, for professional footballers, a season that might never be. Now, suddenly, there is a premiership to be won.\\xa0', 'And everything is new. Players and coaching staff are accustomed to merely days between rounds. Eleven weeks have passed since the season was abruptly paused. What lessons were learned from round one? How will clubs have spent the hiatus, tinkering and remodelling a gameplan that might have floundered in March but could flourish in June?', 'How will teams utilise the interchange bench? Most finished round one with plenty of rotations up their sleeves, a clear nod to shorter quarters and the consequent need for fewer changes. Will this become a trend or, with player fitness a great unknown, will rotations head north?', 'It is worth noting teams have had just four contact training sessions to fit them for the resumption of the season. How will players cope with stands that are empty or near empty? What of the teams relocated on the Gold Coast? How advantaged are the clubs who, for now, will play a disproportionate number of games from the comfort of home?', 'These are questions that will be answered as the fullness, or otherwise, of this unique season unravels. The asterisk that will forever accompany the 2020 premiers is spoken of in negative terms by most, but not McLachlan.', '“I think they’ll have an asterisk to say it’s one of the great premierships,” he said. “Whoever wins the flag this year will obviously have delivered on the field, and they will have had to be the most disciplined, resilient, deep, competitive, mentally tough team off the field. It will be an unbelievable premiership to win.”', 'Follow the build up to the season restart and the game between Richmond and Collingwood with the Guardian’s liveblog from 3pm AEDT on Thursday.']","AFL","Sport","2020-06-10",18.3,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6522bac00b29e9e511eca355acec909375ec327/0_283_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d4c4daf909076ff02969570ba1222e3a","Dustin Martin and Richmond get the AFL season back under way against Collingwood on Thursday night.

Before that his last competitive outing was at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December 2019. Using the current season’s cars is banned under regulations so Hamilton took to the track using the Mercedes W09 from 2018, a car with which he won the world championship. With the season starting with an intense programme of three races in succession, putting in time behind the wheel in advance was seen as essential.', 'Hamilton completed a substantial period of running in wet and dry conditions and pronounced himself very satisfied with the results.', '“When you leave the garage the first time, you get this buzz, and it doesn’t matter how many years you do it, it always feels new and fresh,” he said. “Obviously this is an older car, but it still felt fantastic. We got through a solid programme today.', '“I didn’t feel like I’ve ever left the water, so that’s a positive. Every time you take a big break – I think it’s been 103 days or something – you always wonder whether you can still drive. So it’s a good feeling to know of course I can, I’m ready, I feel fit.”', 'Mercedes ran a similar test for Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, on Tuesday and applied their new operating protocols across both days. F1 is intending to run each race as a closed biosphere and teams are expected to commit to minimising risks.', 'The Mercedes crew operated wearing face masks, and in some cases full facial protection for team members who had to operate in proximity to drivers – such as when they are being strapped into the car. All team members were practising physical distancing and were tested for coronavirus before they got to the circuit. All returned negative results and Hamilton wore a face mask when he was not in the car.', 'The team implemented a range of procedures including a full grid-start simulation. When racing resumes the starting-grid process will involve a far more limited number of personnel than is usual.', 'Ferrari are expected to run a similar programme at their test track in Fiorano. The F1 season opens with races in Austria on 5 and 12 July before a third in Budapest on 19 July, all held behind closed doors.

  ["Martin Braithwaite: 'Middlesbrough to Barcelona, it's been a hell of a journey'","['Denmark striker seemed an unlikely signing for Barcelona but has been proving people wrong ever since he spent two years in a wheelchair as a child']","['The more Martin Braithwaite crept round behind her back, the more suspicious his wife grew and by the time he came clean she had already rumbled him. “She felt something going on because I was having a lot of phone calls, sneaking out the house when it was freezing outside,” the Denmark striker says, stopping, laughing and starting up again. “She was wondering, almost asking if I have a mistress or something. And the night I said: ‘I have to tell you something.’ She said: ‘I know what you’re going to say.’”', 'The secret had slipped out: Braithwaite was joining Barcelona. He had kept quiet for weeks until he was certain it would happen and if he wasn’t telling Anne-Laure, he wasn’t telling anyone.', '“But the day I wanted to tell her, everything broke, my phone got bombarded all day. I was thinking ‘oh, shit’. Her phone was the same, so she wasn’t surprised when I sat her down. I was disappointed I couldn’t get that shock reaction but she was really happy and she understood that I didn’t tell her.”', 'Just two days later the man who had played – or, too often, hadn’t played – in the Championship for Middlesbrough and had just escaped a relegation battle with Leganés\\xa0was running on to the Camp Nou pitch to join Lionel Messi. This was it, and the first time he got the ball in a decent position, he looked up, steadied himself, and ... sliced it into the stands.', 'Braithwaite is laughing now. It helps he knows what comes next – a hand in two goals, including an assist for Messi, whose embrace prompted him to joke, “I won’t wash this shirt” – but he even then he was not disturbed. “It’s funny,” he says. “I think my head doesn’t work like others. I didn’t think about that for a second. Afterwards people said: ‘It shows your character: you did a huge mistake, you looked like you couldn’t play football, kicking the ball miles away’ … and it just got me smiling because football, life, is about taking risks.', '“If you walk around in a bubble and don’t try to get out, you’ll be safe but you’ll never learn. I’m not afraid to make mistakes or embarrass myself. When babies learn to walk, they don’t judge themselves when they fall. Keep going, keep learning.”', 'Look where you may end up. Listen to how enthusiastically he embraces the opportunity, the education. Even before joining Leganés, Braithwaite spent weeks watching videos, analysing their play, what chances would fall his way. At Leganés, that meant getting close to Guido Carrillo. At Barcelona, it means Messi – the man of whom he said: “If football’s a religion, he’s its God.”', '“Messi takes attention away. People forget to look at what’s happening around him because he’s such a threat. There’s space and we have to understand how to exploit that. Then when you do, [opponents] realise ‘these guys are making runs: watch out’ and then you’re giving space to Messi. It’s about intelligence,” he says.\\xa0“I was really excited to play with Luis Suárez, too. He was injured butnow he’s back and I’m looking at him: how he moves. I ask questions, I’m learning. The knowledge these players have is priceless.”', 'Coaching staff confirm they have rarely had a footballer ask so many questions, so determined to understand. “I don’t like to see myself as different but I am curious, I want to learn, think about the game differently, mentally and technically.”', 'Different to Middlesbrough, for sure. It’s hard to imagine two more contrasting managers than Quique Setién\\xa0and Tony Pulis; slightly bizarre to think the player who did not entirely succeed on Teesside is at Barcelona. Signed by Garry Monk, Braithwaite was not enamoured with Pulis’s approach while the manager described him as “ungrateful” for saying he could not imagine returning to Middlesbrough after his loan at Leganés. Some accused Braithwaite of not trying, something that simply does not fit with the man seen in Spain. Or, he says, the man there: “I’m the same person.”', '“I’m grateful,” he says. “I learnt a lot. I don’t have a problem [not playing] because a manager has hard decisions. I didn’t fit. That’s life. It’s normal, not personal. It adds different tools for me for the future. No hard feelings. Only, things were said that are far from the truth – some really, really bad comments after I left.', '“We’re human and football is full of emotion. Middlesbrough supporters are passionate and I loved that. I believe in freedom of speech; people are allowed to show their disappointment. I shared that disappointment. People next to me know my values. It’s just a shame some try to create a picture of me. But it’s part of who I’ve become, what I learnt, what brought me here. It’s been a hell of a journey.”', 'His Guyanese father and Danish mother met in the US, his wife is French and he had trials at Newcastle and Reggina, before playing in Denmark, England, France and Spain, when he might not have played at all.', '“I spent two years in a wheelchair. I had something called Legg-Calve-Perthes, a hip disease. You have to rest your hip, not put pressure on it, because it can turn soft and become deformed. I was really young, five to seven, and I don’t have a lot of memories. Before, I have memories. But it was a sad time so I think I erased this.\\xa0', '“My parents have explained it and I do remember wanting to play football, looking at everyone playing. I needed someone on me because I was trying to jump out of the wheelchair. My dad says when I played again it made him sad: he could see his son running around but he was limping.', '“People ask if I’ve brought that into my life. Not on a conscious level; subconsciously, maybe there’s something in me that’s helped me to be grateful and have an understanding. But consciously, no.”', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'Maybe it’s there in how he rejects the usual appeals for time to settle, in the refusal to waste time; perhaps in part too because he needs to convince quickly if he\\xa0is to stay at the Camp Nou for five years – and he is adamant that he will. “We only have now, we don’t have ‘in six months.’ We have to make time work for us. I just wanted to get started, I don’t like making excuses.”', 'He had barely started when he stopped again; 20 days into Braithwaite’s Barcelona career, lockdown began. He had to return to his home in Madrid, which did at least mean attending the birth of his fourth child, Valentino. “I’m really grateful,” he says, smiling. “I’ve heard a lot of people are getting a divorce [in lockdown] but I realised I really loved my wife: we got even closer.”', 'Lockdown also allowed for video analysis – “the perfect time” – and the chance to follow investments he and his uncle Philip – “more like a brother” – have in the US, a real estate project aimed at creating a new generation of investors, especially women and ethnic minorities. “We want to show people that as humans we’re powerful, more than we believe and we’re getting told.”', 'Conversation turns to events since the killing of George Floyd. “It’s terrible, it’s terrible. And I’m happy for the reaction, that people are getting together to change this. We’ve been seeing this too long, it’s sad [racism] is still happening. Football’s the biggest sport; it’s important we send a message.”', 'Back to the football, then. After all, on Saturday Barcelona return to La Liga action two points clear at the top with 11 games left, packed into a 30-day sprint. Three months and three matches since he arrived, the Barcelona career Braithwaite did not dare tell his wife about gets under way again, only different now. How does he imagine it?', '“I take inspiration from other sports, how they train the mind. I’m thinking: ‘Why aren’t we doing these things in football?’ I’m trying to bring this into my routine. Your body can’t tell the difference between reality and what you see in your mind, so you can improve through visualisation.', '“Usually when we imagine ourselves in a stadium, we see a full stadium; now I turn it around: I’m stepping on to a pitch where there’s no one. I’ve seen it so many times in my head now that it will be no surprise when it happens. Mentality will play a big part. You can’t say: ‘We lost points; next game we have to ...’ There’s no time for that.', '“I woke up today the way a kid wakes up for Christmas, with a big smile on my face.

  ["Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury agree terms of two-fight deal","['Eddie Hearn ‘looking at venues and dates’', 'First meeting of British pair to take place in 2021']","['Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, Britain’s world heavyweight champions, are “making great progress” towards signing for a two-fight unification deal, according to Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn. The news has excited bookmakers but left more disinterested observers wondering when, where and if it will happen.', 'There is much wrangling to be done before the most anticipated fight in the business comes even close to fruition, although Hearn insists Joshua, who holds three versions of the title, and Fury, the unbeaten WBC champion, are already “in agreement regarding the financial terms”. That would seem to gel with a surprise statement last week by Frank Warren that his fighter, Fury, would be willing to split the purse 50‑50.', 'Such unanimity between promoters who have never even met, let alone exchanged civil words, is as rare as a trusted handshake in boxing, but at least the signs are encouraging. While Fury has captured attention beyond his sport with his giant personality, a story of redemption straight from Hollywood and a rousing stoppage of the American Deontay Wilder, Joshua has had to regain lost ground with the public after losing an unbeaten record and his title to Andy Ruiz last year. He did that with a convincing points victory in the rematch last December to win back his WBA, IBF and WBO belts, the bargaining chips he needed even to begin talks with Fury.', '“We’re making great progress,” Hearn told Sky Sports News. “There is still a lot to overcome. We are looking at venues and dates.', '“It’s fair to say [they] are in agreement regarding the financial terms of the fight. The main positive news is that Joshua and Fury have agreed to a two-fight deal, in essence. The most difficult part of any deal is the financial element. I believe we’re in a great place where both guys have agreed to what that should be. We have not signed contracts because there are still things to be worked out.', '“We’re pushing towards a place where they can be drafted, for 2021. Both guys are in agreement. The structure of the deal has been put forward, and agreed to by both parties.”', 'One hurdle is the pandemic that has paralysed sport. There was boxing of sorts on ESPN in the US this week, but without an audience, and it felt as flat as the canvas. Fighting in a near-empty hall robs pugilism of its essence, although Hearn still has plans to hold four nights of boxing over 28 days in July and August in the 15-acre grounds of his Matchroom headquarters in Romford.', 'There has been no sanctioned boxing in the UK since March, however, and it is difficult to gauge if fans will warm to a promotion with only the televised echo of leather on skin for atmosphere.', 'Bookmakers, meanwhile, weighed in quickly on a Fury-Joshua match-up. William Hill did not hesitate to make Fury a 2-1 on favourite, with Joshua at 6-4. Their boxing spokesperson, Rupert Adams, said, “Tyson was so dominant against Wilder that we feel we have to make him the favourite to go on and beat Joshua.” Paddy Power have Fury at 7-4 on and Joshua at 11-8, which seems about right. ', 'As for the venue, the Irish bookmakers think Hearn will take the fight back to Saudi Arabia, where Joshua beat Ruiz, and where there is much money available still in the coffers of the government’s “sportwashing” department.', 'Wherever it might end up – and Wembley would be a more acceptable venue for British fans – it is unlikely to be this year.

Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, thanked both clubs for making it clear to supporters that their presence at or near the ground would not be welcome.', 'Councillor Wendy Simon, the deputy mayor of Liverpool and chair of the council’s safety advisory group, said: “We are satisfied that the considerable evidence provided by the government, Everton and Liverpool football clubs, public health colleagues and Merseyside police will ensure that the outstanding fixtures for the Premier League season can be safely and securely played at both Goodison Park and Anfield.', '“A lot of factors have been taken into consideration, especially the safety of the players, match officials and staff. We are confident the measures in place will allow the matches to be held behind closed doors without detrimental impact. We would advise that everyone, wherever they may be watching these fixtures, strongly adhere to the guidance on social distancing.”With regard to the derby, which will be broadcast free to air, the Merseyside assistant chief constable, Rob Carden, said: “Working together with both teams, we want to ensure everyone enjoys the game from the safety of their own home. In relation to crime and disorder we have no objections to any of the home fixtures being played at their respective grounds, the main concern was always public health.', '“It is not the role of the police to make operational decisions on the basis of public health, we have been guided by experts and the government. We are still in unprecedented times and there are strong concerns in Merseyside and the wider north-west due to the fact the R-rate here is still higher than in the rest of the country. For that reason we would urge supporters to do the right thing – stay at home and keep your family, friends and neighbours safe.”', 'The supporters’ groups Blue Union and Spirit of Shankly were represented at the safety group meeting and welcomed the decision. A statement said: “Building on the magnificent community work both sets of fans have done throughout this pandemic, we are confident supporters will respect safety advice and avoid visiting stadia. We fully understand the importance of lockdown as a measure to control Covid-19 and would encourage fans to stay away.”', 'Everton have confirmed that Theo Walcott will miss the restart after undergoing abdominal surgery.

With club owners having voted this week to reduce the annual salary cap by £1.4m from 2021-22, putting an additional squeeze on squad wages, the RPA cannot rule out a walkout.\\xa0', '“We very much see it as the last action and something you would look to avoid for the benefit of all stakeholders, because it is an extreme move,” said Lambert, the long-serving Harlequins front-row forward.', '“But it is difficult for us to entirely rule out any options when we’re in the situation where we’ve got members with existing, fixed-term contracts essentially being strong-armed into thinking they have no choice but to sign an inferior contract.”', 'Lambert said Premiership Rugby’s desire to make permanent 25% wage cuts has been “unanimously rejected” by the players’ board and has warned of legal action. “From the outset of this crisis there has been an absolute disregard for the players and the values of the game,” he said.', '“Players at some clubs are now being served with ultimatums and being put under undue pressure to sign amended contracts through the manufactured deadline of 18 June.', '“To be clear, this is a totally unacceptable way to operate. Players are the lifeblood of the game and should be treated with respect. This latest situation could have been entirely avoided with a collaborative and transparent approach and we now find ourselves heading towards a significant legal dispute unless meaningful and genuine dialogue takes place urgently. In the meantime the RPA position remains unequivocal: the RPA is opposed to permanent cuts for our members.”', 'There is also disquiet that clubs are trying to force through pay cuts just months after collecting a £10m windfall apiece from the private equity firm CVC. Many clubs are still struggling to stay afloat financially and the RPA’s chief executive, Damian Hopley, said last month that his members were worried about the wider outlook for their sport.', '“We’ve been on calls to some clubs where there is a very genuine concern the club might not last the year based on the current financial projections,” Hopley said. “We don’t want to have a sport where there are only six clubs left at Christmas.”', 'Hopley is adamant that collective agreement is the best way forward. “Everyone recognises the world is a very different place to three months ago but the most important thing a player has is his contract.”', 'The Premiership season is to resume on 15 August, with the majority of players having started to return to training.']","Premiership","Sport","2020-06-10",13.08,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaac9b9425ed8b49b54819d4bf02cd658518f32e/0_37_4447_2668/master/4447.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8b6a919b2cbd0e3aac2c6756b1a3e401","Mark Lambert of Harlequins (centre) says ‘players are the lifeblood of the game and should be treated with respect’.

  ["Premier League restart preview No 6: Chelsea","['Frank Lampard will be desperate to hold on to a Champions League place and Kovacic, Pulisic and Loftus-Cheek should be back from injuries ']","['What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Frank Lampard had bristled when January passed without any arrivals at Stamford Bridge, warning that hopes of finishing in the top four were under threat. His concerns looked justified when his inconsistent side were beaten at home by Manchester United on 17 February. The most inexperienced manager in the league had seen frailties in attack and defence and although victory against Tottenham followed, Chelsea’s shortage of quality was hammered home when Bayern ran riot in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.', 'Yet there were positive signs. Kepa Arrizabalaga regained his spot in goal, while Olivier Giroud and Pedro started to fire in attack after injuries led to them being brought in from the cold. Then there was the impact of Billy Gilmour, who got his chance because of a selection crisis in midfield. The 18-year-old made a stunning impact in the victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup and his poise on the ball stood out when Chelsea, showing rare conviction in attack, tightened their grip on fourth place with a 4-0 thrashing of Everton on 8 March.', 'What about now? The break stalled Chelsea’s momentum but it has allowed injured players to return. Mateo Kovacic has shaken off a minor knock, Christian Pulisic is back from the adductor problem that has kept him out since 1 January and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will hopefully be ready to compete after recovering from an achilles injury. However it remains to be seen if N’Golo Kanté will be available after expressing health fears about coronavirus. Giroud and Willy Caballero have signed one-year contract extensions but Willian and Pedro could yet leave on free transfers on 30 June. Lampard will not want to lose them before the campaign is over – after all Chelsea will not have the RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner at their disposal until next season.', 'What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? With Werner close to joining for £53m, Hakim Ziyech due to arrive from Ajax and Lampard keen to sign Leicester’s Ben Chilwell, Chelsea cannot afford to miss out on Champions League qualification. The job is far from done, with Lampard’s side three points above fifth-placed Manchester United and five clear of Wolves and Sheffield United. Chelsea have often struggled to kill off teams, especially at home, and have shipped too many soft goals. They need to be more calm, more focused in defence and have greater precision in attack. For Lampard, the challenge is demonstrating he has used the time off to devise a more coherent tactical plan. Chelsea, who are also in the FA Cup quarter-finals, have let too many games spiral out of control.', 'Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? Callum Hudson-Odoi was reportedly arrested on the morning of 18 May and later released and bailed until mid-June. Mason Mount had to be reminded of his responsibilities after the midfielder was pictured having a kickabout with West Ham’s Declan Rice on 15 March.', 'Any unsung/community heroes? Chelsea\\xa0have played an active role in the community since the coronavirus outbreak. They\\xa0opened up the Millennium Hotel\\xa0on their Stamford Bridge stadium site to NHS staff \\xa0and teamed up with the domestic abuse charity Refuge to help provide support for people forced to self-isolate in vulnerable situations. The players also donated money to enable the Chelsea Foundation to help those in need during the crisis.', 'Key player in the run-in? Lampard will hope the deal for Werner will fire up Tammy Abraham, Chelsea’s top scorer. Abraham, who has struggled with an ankle injury this year, can link play and is smart inside the box. Chelsea need him to settle tight games.', 'End-of-season prediction Chelsea should have enough to qualify for the Champions League, especially if Manchester City’s ban means fifth place is enough, while their knockout prowess makes them a threat in the FA Cup. However they are unlikely to pull off a dramatic comeback when they play the second leg against Bayern in the Champions League.', 'Remaining fixtures (all times BST):\\xa0Sun 21 June Aston Villa (a) 4.15pm, Sky Sports Thur 25 June Manchester City (h) 8.15pm, Sky Sports Wed 1 July West Ham (a) 8.15pm, Sky Sports TBC Watford (h), Crystal Palace (a), Sheffield United (a), Norwich (h), Liverpool (a), Wolves (h).']","Football","Sport","2020-06-10",11.59,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb5352c491f0fa58b9c268aa863229ec311c5f3/0_241_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=55c6a10f84e150f7d44651e16f00e3b4","Chelsea’s Willian takes flight during training at Stamford Bridge.

Here comes everybody! Or at least, here come Kylian Mbappé, Ferran Torres, Ousmane Dembélé, Kalidou Koulibaly, Adama Traoré, Leroy Sané, Diego Carlos, Wout Weghorst, Talles Magno, Tanguy Ndombele, Thomas Partey, Bukayo Saka and Eduardo Camavinga. Time for a paragraph break?', 'And we go again, with Aster Vranckx, Nicolò Zaniolo, Dominik Szoboszlai, Victor Osimhen, Boubakary Soumaré, Willian, Philippe Coutinho, Marcelo Brozovic, Milot Rashica, Kostas Tsimikas, Marcus Thuram, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho.', 'What do these footballers have in common? All of them have been “linked with” a move to Liverpool. Even better, all of them have been linked with a move to Liverpool in the last two months, a list of suggested transactions that bears repeating only because it is so absurd. We can only hope for the sake of his own sleep patterns that Jürgen Klopp has turned off that Google alert on his phone.', 'There are of course significant caveats to this red-shirted shadow army. “Linked with” is weak gruel at the best of times, shorthand for hopeful agents and arm’s-length bluff. And of course lockdown does funny things to all of us. Right now there is an empty space where football should be, tended by an industry that still needs to produce content.', 'But there is also an edge of reality buried beneath the mound of bodies, a shiver of anxiety as Liverpool’s final step towards the league title looms closer. This is driven in part by the question of what comes next. Something is happening here. But what exactly?', 'The most recent near-miss isn’t on that list. This is of course Timo Werner, who may or may not reach an agreement with Chelsea this week, but who has already become a very public Liverpool non-signing. It is an interesting move in itself, failure to recruit a player presented by Klopp as an act rather than an omission, as a positive choice, another part of a commercially-sound team-building strategy.', 'At £53m Werner was simply the right man in the wrong moment of total economic collapse. Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club’s owners that this seems pretty reasonable. Footballing lore insists that great teams always build from a position of strength: a line that tends to overlook the wider truth that, weak or strong, in football you always need to be building, that even the finest teams exist in a state of constant disintegration.', 'It is this point that some supporters feel most keenly. Liverpool are champions of Europe. Liverpool spent the first six months of the season marching the rest of the field around the Premier League in a headlock. Liverpool have the most resourceful elite-level manager in the world.', 'And yet, there is also an acceptance that a team built on coaching and chemistry is in need of some urgent refreshing. Werner is a high-class player. His arrival would have reflected the success of recent methods, where large amounts have been spent, but on the right players in just the right spot.', 'There is still time. A high-class central defender and a versatile attacker (plenty on that shadow list) are still wanted. But teams are also fragile things. Time is passing. How often do these moments come around, when every element of an organisation aligns on the same course, when a wider generational success can be seen bedding into place?', 'And how often does such a moment coincide with a wider economic collapse and a four-month pause in the workings of everyday life? Liverpool have, above all, been terribly unlucky with timing.', 'This misfortune applies to the recruitment cycle. The significant period of evolution for the current team was between summer 2017 and summer 2018. During that year Alisson, Fabinho, Andy Robertson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah all arrived, while Trent Alexander-Arnold emerged as a first-team player.', 'It has been a brilliant spell of team building. But by the time football returns it will be two years since Liverpool signed a significant player and 12 regular first-team squad members will be 28 or older. Alexander-Arnold is the only young player in the first XI. A period of renewal is due. Klopp knows this better than anyone. It was clearly coming this summer.', 'At which point: enter one global meltdown. The plans hatched to manage this will have been based on a previous version of reality, one in which it made sense to pay large amounts for a single high-class addition, and where commercial and TV income seemed guaranteed in perpetuity.', 'These are fragile margins, too. To reach this stage, to win the Champions League while also achieving record profits, is a wonderful achievement. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Success is a brittle thing. Imagine throwing a broken season plus total business model collapse into the workings of Manchester United 1992, Chelsea 2004 or Barcelona 2005. Success would still come. But earthquakes hardly help, not least ones that seem geared to attack specifically your own points of strength.', 'On the pitch the current Liverpool is built around extreme physicality and beautifully-grooved team chemistry, all of which have been interrupted. It is also a style built with the home crowd in mind, a way of playing that feeds on shared energy. Liverpool haven’t lost a significant domestic match at Anfield in over two years. This is all part of the design, formulated within parameters that have now disappeared. Same for everyone. But how many others had cracked it to this degree?', 'The commercial landscape has also changed. Liverpool became the best club team on the planet by playing the existing rules perfectly. Klopp and Fenway Sports Group have been kings of the FFP era, obeying the rules of engagement and exploiting their own resources better than anyone else at that level in Europe.', 'Well, say goodbye to all that. It is fairly clear that financial fair play will be given minimal policing from here as football looks to rake in every penny it can. A club like Chelsea is suddenly back in that position of power, with access to a bottomless set of pockets, and prepared to spend speculatively.', 'The game has changed. Will Liverpool change with it?', 'Not so far, and rightly so. Be true to thine own self: the most Klopp-era thing Liverpool could have done at a time of falling revenues, pay cuts and social division was to walk away from a £200,000-a-week new signing.', 'There will no doubt be money to spend. But success to date has arrived hand in hand with being able to read the room, and in this case the commercial management has once again followed its instincts. Who knows, in time Werner-to-Liverpool might turn out to be one of the great non-signings, an era-defining non-signing.

It shouldn’t take an Amnesty investigation for workers to be paid what they are owed.”', 'Amnesty also criticised Fifa for not doing more to put pressure on Qatar. “If, over the past 10 years, Fifa had held its World Cup partners to account, and used its clout to push Qatar to fully reform its systems, we wouldn’t be hearing the same tales of workers’ suffering with only two-and-a-half years until kick-off,” added Cockburn.', 'Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy told Amnesty that it first learned of QMC’s payment problems in July 2019 and had since taken various measures to try to remedy the situation , including meeting the company’s management, blacklisting it from future contracts and informing the Ministry of Labour.', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'However Amnesty said it was still unacceptable that many workers had gone from September 2019 to March 2020 without pay.', '“Although recent payments will provide some welcome relief for workers, Qatar’s World Cup organisers told us they had known about the salary delays since July 2019,” added Cockburn. “This raises the question of why Qatar allowed workers to continue working for months without pay.”', 'QMC told Amnesty the payment delays were due to financial difficulties and said it was trying to resolve them.']","World Cup 2022","Sport","2020-06-11",0.01,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15d514bb3ac4fbd7a2f072ad3eb2f4f5e74996d3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a449afd228e1ce2627a8d6a1170d6a90","The Al Bayt Stadium in Doha, Qatar has been described as one of the ‘crown jewels’ of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

McIlroy cited his own idolisation of Tiger Woods as a reason why skin colour shouldn’t lead to the placement of barriers.', 'After a three-month absence triggered by coronavirus, the PGA Tour will restart with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas. It is the death of Floyd, rather than the pandemic, which feels most prominent on the landscape after demonstrations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Tour has initiated a moment of silence each day in Floyd’s memory and left the 8.46 tee time free, in reference to the period he was pinned to the ground by a policeman in Minneapolis.', '“A great word that I’ve sort of been thinking of over the last couple of weeks is ‘tolerance,’” said McIlroy. “I think everyone can just be a little more tolerant, and a little more educated and not as ignorant.', '“My hero growing up was Tiger Woods. Tiger doesn’t look the same as me, has had a very different upbringing to the one that I have had, but he was my hero growing up, and it didn’t matter what colour his skin was, what his beliefs were. Tiger was my hero, and he’s been a lot of kids’ heroes over the years that have grown up playing golf. We’ve been very lucky to have him in our game. I think that there should be more people like him in golf.”', 'McIlroy was struck by a conversation, filmed in recent days, between Harold Varner and the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan. Varner is one of a tiny number of black PGA Tour members. “These issues I think really hit home with me,” McIlroy explained. “Harold said, it maybe just isn’t about the players, it’s about everyone in the game of golf. There’s so many people that are involved with the game, and as long as we continue to give people from different backgrounds opportunities to be in golf, that can only be a good thing.”', 'Woods called last week for a “safer, unified society” on account of the “shocking tragedy” of Floyd. The 15-times major winner is not in the Charles Schwab field but speculation suggests he may feature next week when the PGA Tour reaches South Carolina.', 'McIlroy, who reiterated his belief that a world circuit in golf would be beneficial, praised the PGA Tour for “robust” Covid-19 procedures. “It has felt very safe,” said the Northern Irishman. “Everyone is doing the right things, and the people that are involved with the tournament are wearing masks and wearing gloves and there’s sanitiser everywhere you look. It feels safe. I feel safe, and I would say basically everyone else that’s here feels the same way.', '“I think it’s an important week because golf can show that we can play in a socially distant manner. We can conduct a tournament and adhere to all the safety protocols that have been put in place.“It is going to be very easy to fall back into old habits because it’s just what we’ve done. I’d say for the viewing public just to give the players and the caddies a little bit of leeway in terms of if they see something on TV that isn’t quite right. We’re having to figure it out as we go along, as well.

But at the moment we all understand that’s not possible. It’s a temporary thing and hopefully it won’t last too long. The demand for the sport is there. We want to be able to provide it in the best way possible.”', 'Green said audiences had reacted positively since BT added crowd noise to its live coverage of Bundesliga matches and added that Premier League fans would be given the chance to switch the feature off during games.', '“I was surprised by how well received it was by our viewers, particularly on social media, and some of the feedback we’ve had from the press and radio as well,” Green said. “We are stepping forward and next weekend, after working with the Premier League and EA Sports, crowd noise will be offered as standard, with the ability for anybody who doesn’t want it to take it away. The option will be to remove it rather than to step into it.', '“We believe that crowds are what hold sports together. We are looking at how to bring live fans into the coverage in a very restrictive and intimate way in some capacity across the studio coverage, whether it be the early kick-off before the first game we show next Saturday or in our post-match show.”', 'Green, who said BT had been hit financially during the coronavirus pandemic, is confident fans will watch games in empty stadiums. “It does impact us but there is an intrigue to it,” he said. “We’re working with the Premier League, we’ve worked with the Bundesliga and we’ve seen the effect of not having crowds.', '“The viewing figures for the Bundesliga, the averages even now are well up prior to what they were before Covid. It’s the only live football at the moment but there does seem to be a genuine interest in watching live sport, with or without crowds.', '“Having watched the Bundesliga we are all acutely aware it’s not quite the product it was previously. But the emotional interest and attachment people have to football in this country is such that it will still be a very strong television product. Without crowds it does open up opportunities to use innovation to enhance coverage.”', 'BT’s first game will be Watford v Leicester on 20 June.']","Premier League","Sport","2020-06-11",18.58,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cccd5ae7dd5d1871a88179dd3e69a33103f599/0_76_7205_4322/master/7205.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=1a065dd5b7e6a00e4868232abe47a686","BT Sport plans to enhance the viewing experience with artificial crowd noise when showing matches without fans.

The second goal came when Toby Alderweireld turned a Vardy header into his own net, meaning that Spurs have lost two and drawn one of their past three fixtures. It was Leicester who jumped up into second place – four points behind Liverpool.', '“We started bad,” Mourinho said. “The first 20 minutes was a poor performance, some empty spots in terms of pressing, attitude, recovering the ball. I didn’t like [it] at all. The fact we didn’t start well is not because I didn’t tell them to start well. I didn’t tell them: ‘Don’t be proactive or be reactive.’ But I admit we did start bad.', '“We changed during the first half, adapting the positions in midfield. We improved a lot, had a period of domination and then the penalty. The penalty is not a penalty created, it’s a penalty that we commit. For me, iIt was out of context to the game at that moment because it was our best period. Aurier made a mistake. But before his mistake we had other players making mistakes in other areas of the pitch. I can’t blame a player for a mistake.”', 'Brendan Rodgers described Leicester’s performance as “outstanding”, strategically “amazing” and the victory as “thoroughly deserved”. Mourinho did not agree. “It is a game we lost on a penalty and an own goal and the result looks like the opponents were totally in control or better than us, but that is not the reality,” he said. “Our performance was not good but the game was not like they deserved to win or we deserved to lose.

But on the issue of extra substitutes, described by the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, as one of “player welfare and mental health”, the vote was split down the middle.', 'Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leicester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield United, West Ham and Wolves voted to stick to the maximum of three changes per team. The league did, however, agree to extend the number of listed substitutes from seven per team to nine.', 'As a result the English top flight remains the only major league in Europe not to have expanded the number of substitutes in a season heavily compacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It also stands alone in England, with the EFL and FA Cup having increased their substitute numbers.', 'Private anger is spreading among top clubs who believe the chance to change has passed without a case for keeping the rules having been made publicly.', 'It is understood that whereas Manchester City and Liverpool made the case for a rule change during the shareholders’ meeting, no counter-argument was presented. It is widely held, however, that clubs reluctant to adjust the rules feel any change would embed a competitive advantage for those clubs with deeper squads.', 'The likelihood is the “nays” knew they had enough votes to prevail. Any motion must carry 14 shareholder votes to enter the Premier League rulebook. Despite a recent meeting of top-flight managers suggesting that as many as 15 wanted change, it had become clear before Thursday’s meeting that some were unable to carry their clubs with them. David Moyes, for example, has said he changed his opinion and would consider allowing five substitutions but West Ham voted against it.', 'In other items of business at the meeting, the league chose to follow the FA in endorsing the use of concussion substitutes. In a trial that could begin as early as next month a team may make up to two permanent substitutions per match to protect players suspected of suffering concussion. In the event of one team making such a change, the opposition will be granted an extra substitution.', 'Shareholders also voted in favour of extending the league’s broadcast deal with beIN Sports in the Middle East and north Africa until 2025. Valued at $500m (£368m), it replicates the terms of the previous contract and will provide a boost to the league in the week French clubs turned to the government for emergency funding after the collapse of a TV deal.']","Premier League","Sport","2020-12-17",16.55,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29448b095e55570bd6d485c89fa48e2b6ba88af8/0_171_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4b86555bbaaefe5e05d760a36c53b70d","Jürgen Klopp prepares to bring on four substitutes during Liverpool’s Champions League game at home to Atalanta in November.

Some regard it as the most important decision Football Federation Australia will make in shaping the future of the women’s game.', 'The new coach will lead Australia’s “golden generation” to four major tournaments over the next four years, encompassing perhaps their best ever chance at coming out the other side with a major international trophy.', 'But while all eyes have been focused on who could fill arguably the most coveted position in international women’s football, FFA have made sure that whoever leads the Matildas in the future will not do so alone.', 'On Wednesday, FFA announced former Canberra United head coach Rae Dower – who has spent the last three years leading Australia’s Under-17s team, the Junior Matildas – has been elevated to the role of women’s technical advisor to complement her youth team position.', 'While it received far less attention from the media and the wider football community, it is an appointment that is arguably just as important as who will take the reins of the senior team next month.', 'Dower is now the most senior woman in a technical position within the national governing body, joining former Socceroos technical analyst Ron Smith in advising interim technical director Trevor Morgan on the future of the Australian game.', 'The unique challenges facing women’s football, however, means that there is no one-size-fits-all approach dictated from above – making Dower’s appointment all the more crucial.', '“There are obviously lots of similarities within the game – it’s still a round ball, still the same dimensions of the field, all the rules are the same – but there are some characteristics and different ways that [women] get to the top of the pyramid compared to the boys,” Dower told Guardian Australia.', '“[This role] is an opportunity to collaborate more within the women’s national teams unit and to see where we can collaborate a little bit more with member federations as well – the states – and try to move our pathways forward in terms of our women’s programs.', '“The experience that I’ve had working in and around a number of different states now and working across the national team program, I’ll be able to provide a little bit more bespoke advice to Trevor in relation to that.” ', 'It is revealing, perhaps, of FFA’s intended direction that Dower and Morgan both come to their new technical roles from a background of youth club development. While Dower emerged through the Canberra United Academy where she produced and funnelled players into the W-League side she eventually led to two trophies, Morgan’s career has seen him involved with the Young Socceroos, the Western Sydney Wanderers’ youth team, and as football director at Westfield Sports High School, which has produced several senior Matildas and Socceroos.', '“The emergence of the academy system throughout the country with the A-League academies, a lot of that development is done by […] clubs,” Dower said. “We’re not yet in the position that we want to be in yet with the W-League clubs being able to have that full line in the pathway.', '“I think the A-League and W-League clubs acknowledge that we would want those pathways aligned. We’re probably a little bit further off them in the girls’ pathway, [but] we’re working hand-in-hand with the member federations and their development programs – their national training centre programs – and eventually that’s producing players for their W-League clubs, especially in the upcoming season with the borders being restricted.', '“We’re going to rely on our domestic product and domestic players, and that’s going to give so many great opportunities for players who might have thought it was a bit beyond them.”', 'There is also a desire from FFA to address the under-performance of Australia’s youth teams on the international stage. Dower will work closely with the new senior Matildas coach to ensure that the current “golden generation” of Matildas is not the last.', '“You know as well as I do that there’s some really exciting players around,” Dower said. “When people say, ‘oh, there’s nothing coming through, where are they coming from?’ I just say, ‘they’re there! Go and watch them! Every weekend, they’re playing!’', '“They just need the right environment and the right opportunity to get that experience and make that next step. You can’t ever really prove what a player’s potential is going to be. You’ve got some good ideas, you’ve got your own experience, but unless you actually give players opportunities, you never know what they’re capable of.', '“If we’re saying this is a golden generation, we’re kind of capping ourselves.

We haven’t changed our philosophy since coming back into the Premier League and Leeds won’t be doing so either. It will be very, very interesting tactically.”', 'It will also be the first time two clubs separated by 41 miles have faced each other in the Premier League for 26 years, since they drew 2-2 at Bramall Lane in March 1994.', 'In a normal year this would have been the loudest of big occasions, with Bramall Lane packed to the rafters and Woolley Edge services on the M1 between Leeds and Sheffield thronged with devoted Bielsaites. ', '“Bramall Lane’s like a ghost town,” Wilder says. “You don’t feel the vibe but we have to find a way to adapt.” Every club feels the ache of their supporters’ absence but Sheffield United are arguably struggling with the silence more than most.', 'Billy Sharp feels it acutely. “I’m gutted there’s going to be no fans on Sunday,” says Wilder’s 34-year-old former Leeds striker. “I’m not going to lie, you don’t get the same buzz on a matchday. You don’t get the buzz when you drive into an away ground on the bus and when you warm up; you don’t get the same adrenaline.', '“Fans are the biggest part of the game, it’s not the same sport without them. The players are frustrated – we want them back. I see coffee shops all over Sheffield filled with people and I get frustrated. With the measures we’ve got in place now, there’s no better, safer place for them than a football ground.”', 'Sharp, a close friend and golf partner of the Leeds captain Liam Cooper who may well end up marking him, played under four managers in his sole season at Elland Road but appreciates Bielsa’s advent has changed everything.', '“Sunday’s a match between two great clubs from two great cities,” he says. “We haven’t got a point on the board yet so we’re going to have to up our game against them.”', 'Sheffield United fans fear “second season syndrome” and fret over the tendency of teams who impress in the first year after promotion to succumb to gravity’s pull the following year.', 'It remains very early days but the defeats by Aston Villa – when the Blades played with 10 men for 80 minutes after John Egan’s controversial red card – and Wolves ensured Wilder’s wife had to remind him Wednesday was his 53rd birthday. “When you haven’t got a point, celebrations don’t come into it,” he says. “We need to improve in both boxes.”', 'Given Leeds’s first two fixtures – a defeat at Liverpool and victory against Fulham – involved 4-3 scorelines, Bielsa knows Leeds need to up their defensive game.', 'Although Patrick Bamford has confounded the doubters by doing so well in front of goal that on Friday a slightly astounded Bielsa was asked whether the striker deserved an England call-up. The Leeds manager knows his side cannot keep scoring at the same rate.', '“We can’t maintain such efficiency so we have to not concede so many,” he says, before suggesting he has found something of a soulmate in Wilder. Although, in many ways, the two men are very different, both have long steered clear of tactical groupthink and dare to be different.', '“Sheffield United set themselves up unusually, with uncommon tactics but they’re very loyal to their style of play,” says Bielsa, who sent Wilder congratulatory, and classy text messages when Sheffield United pipped Leeds to promotion in 2019. “The way Chris Wilder manages and sets his team up awakens a lot of interest in me to learn from him. He has a clear concept. He can ingrain his ideas into players and make the way they play look comfortable. He’s a very good manager.”', 'Given Wilder’s conviction that Bielsa speaks infinitely better English than advertised, their post-match conversation promises to be the stuff of an Amazon football documentary-maker’s dreams.']","Sheffield United","Sport","2020-09-26",11,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556fcdeb978631d5e17a36eb44a38bea6e8ba1aa/0_227_3688_2212/master/3688.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d5ecb30dc118cb58a07953e329731c3a","Chris Wilder’s Sheffield United have lost their opening two Premier League games, against Wolves and Aston Villa.

However, without her legacy and the work she did both during her playing days and after her retirement, this dream may never have become a reality.', 'This week Clark announced that she will step down from her role at Cricket Australia as executive general manager of community cricket on 30 November, although she will continue as a director of the local organising committee for the 2022 men’s T20 World Cup.', 'A giant of the game, Clark holds a slew of impressive playing records. She remains the Australian women’s team’s highest ODI run scorer of all time, has the record for the most appearances as captain and was the first player, male or female, to score a double century in an ODI.', 'But it is off the field that she has had arguably the most impact, spending 20 years working with Cricket Australia in a variety of demanding administrative roles. Former Australia captain Alex Blackwell regards Clark as one of the most important figures of the sport in Australia.', '“When Belinda Clark speaks, you stop and listen,” she said. “She’s very good at putting the message across clearly, firmly and with optimism. What she says makes sense and she follows through with it – you can see the change happening around her as a result of her leadership.”', 'Clark has long been a tireless advocate for women’s cricket, taking on the role of chief executive of women’s cricket Australia while still captaining the national team and seeing the women’s game through the merger with the Australian Cricket Board in 2003.', 'Being a women’s cricketer in Clark’s era involved a great deal of sacrifice – there was no monetary reward on offer and players had to juggle elite cricket with paid employment and were often heavily involved in grass roots cricket to ensure there were opportunities for the next generation of female players coming through the ranks.', 'Clark’s passion for community cricket has been evident for many years – from her own playing days as a child in Newcastle, through to her role as a development officer with Cricket NSW and into her current role steering community cricket programs and initiatives with the national body. Her belief in the power of cricket to change lives and empower young people made her a strong leader in this space.', 'One of the big developments she oversaw was the rule changes for junior cricket introduced in 2017, in which the length of pitches were shortened, boundaries brought in and more guaranteed batting and bowling time for younger players was factored in. Blackwell regards this as one of Clark’s greatest achievements as an administrator.', '“She came in to run community cricket and she really revolutionised it,” Blackwell said. “She and her team analysed how we can do this better and came up with a research-based and really creative way to solve the problem and then were able to translate to all those hard-working volunteers how to make it work on the ground.”', 'Her time at Cricket Australia also included a stint as interim executive general manager of team performance following the exit of Pat Howard, where she faced the unenviable task of managing the reintegration of Steve Smith and David Warner following their suspensions from the sandpaper scandal.

  ["Will Covid-19 postpone the NFL season? There are 16bn reasons why it won't","['A coronavirus outbreak closed two teams’ facilities on Tuesday. Expect the league to do everything in its power to keep the games going']","['Well, they had been. Until Tuesday, only 36 people in the NFL – seven players and 29 staff – had tested positive for Covid-19. When you consider the thousands of people involved in the league, from coaches to players to support staff, that’s not bad. That means that, unlike Major League Baseball, all of this season’s games have gone ahead as scheduled. Good news if you support the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, not so great if you’re a fan of the New York Jets.', 'That’s when news emerged that three players and five other team personnel from the Tennessee Titans had tested positive for Covid-19. The Titans subsequently closed team facilities until Saturday. That means their preparation for their scheduled game on Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers may well be done over Zoom with players practicing on their own. The Minnesota Vikings, who played the Titans on Sunday, have also closed their team facilities, while the officiating crew from that game are also being monitored. Despite the fact that the Titans players had sweated and breathed over each other for a good portion of Sunday, ESPN reported that the NFL is still keen for the Titans-Steelers game to go ahead (it has since emerged the game will be played early next week).', 'NFL wants to and intends to play the Titans-Steelers game as scheduled Sunday; one of the contingency plans to allow for additional testing and contact tracing to occur would be to move the game to Monday night, per source.', '“This is not unexpected,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a Tuesday memo to the NFL’s teams obtained by ESPN. “There will be players and staff who will test positive during the season.” The NFL’s Covid-19 policy means players and staff are tested every day except gameday. Tests are missed on gamedays because the league favours nasal swab tests, the results of which can take a while to come back. That means tests taken before a game may not be returned until after the contest has been played.', 'The NBA has nearly finished its season, and the only disruptions were due to calls for social justice rather than Covid-19. But the NBA’s situation was very different. For a start, NBA teams only have 15 players on their rosters while NFL teams have up to 55 – and that’s before you include coaches, medical staff and the dozens of others who help run a franchise. Added to that, only 22 NBA teams took part when the season resumed in an isolated bubble at Walt Disney World in July – whereas all 32 NFL teams would participate if the league took place in a bubble. That means a venue large enough to host thousands of people would need to be found at very short notice – and the NBA is already occupying one of those. Meanwhile, some teams have started to let fans back into stadiums, albeit it in small numbers.', 'The league has plenty of reasons to be cautious. Some players are asthmatic (although the overweight are more likely to die from Covid-19, obese NFL players are not thought to be at added risk), while many coaches and officials are in their 60s and 70s. There was talk of postponing Sunday’s game and playing it during either the Steelers’ or Titans’ bye week. But the NFL, for all its recent nods to social justice, is proud of its status as a moneymaking behemoth. Unlike baseball, the league doesn’t have the option of postponing games and making them up with doubleheaders or having teams play a few days in a row – professional football is just too hard on the body to schedule any more than one match-up a week for teams. Besides that, it’s not like the league or its owners have displayed too much concern for the health and welfare of their players in the past, as long as the cash keeps rolling in.', 'Then there’s the current political climate in America. TV ratings this season – more important than ever now that fans are largely absent from the stands – have been mixed at best, with those on the left blaming the league for not doing enough to promote social justice and those on the right deriding it for bringing too much politics into the game. The NFL will want to show its fans, detractors and, most importantly, its sponsors and broadcast partners that it still has things under control.', 'Despite the fact that this is a league that took four years to decide whether it supported its players’ right to protest against racism, the NFL magically becomes ruthlessly efficient when money is at issue. With around $16bn at stake, the NFL will do everything in its power to make sure Super Bowl LV goes ahead in Tampa on 7 February.']","NFL","Sport","2020-09-30",12.11,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c7300d50650c9a1912c75958bbfc1611c996316/0_388_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=c2ab011f00f956e43bc178ae78fc2136","Pittsburgh’s JuJu Smith-Schuster wears a towel as a facemask during a celebration in Sunday’s game against Houston.

  ["FIA president Jean Todt calls for return of refuelling during races","[' Move could lead to lighter cars and more overtaking Valtteri Bottas quickest in Friday practice for British GP']","['The president of the FIA, Jean Todt, has said he would like to see a return of in-race refuelling to Formula One as a way to improve the sport. Speaking at Silverstone before this weekend’s British Grand Prix, Todt also insisted that there were various avenues he would like the sport to investigate to improve the show, alongside refuelling, including limiting driver aids and telemetry.', 'Refuelling was last used in F1 in 2009, before it was removed as a cost saving measure and because pit stops were judged to be taking too long. There was a proposal for it to return in the 2017 season which was ultimately rejected, once again largely as an unnecessary additional cost to the teams.', 'Todt believes the cost argument is not valid given how much the teams already spend and could have immediate effect on the racing, not least in making the cars smaller and lighter, contributing to their potential to better follow one another and overtake.', '“The cars have become too heavy which is something we have discussed,” he said. “I am pushing for analysing what it would mean if we introduced refuelling. If we did that you would have a lighter car at the start of the race and a smaller car. When I hear it will be more expensive it makes me smile. When I see the size of the motor homes I don’t think it is the price that will be the killer to introducing it.”', 'The regulation changes set for 2021 are still under discussion between the teams, the FIA and the sport’s owners, Liberty Media. The next meeting is due to take place on 23 July , with October set as the deadline to conclude their agreement.', 'On the track at Silverstone, Mercedes looked strong in practice on Friday, once again edging out the Ferraris. The morning session, interrupted by rain and a red flag when Kimi Räikkönen’s Alfa Romeo suffered an engine failure on track. Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton had led the early runs but after the rain Pierre Gasly took the top spot for Red Bull.', 'In the more representative second session, Bottas was quickest, just six hundredths in front of Hamilton. The British driver looked like he had yet to quite find the limit on the newly resurfaced track and with changeable wind conditions.

  ["Diego Schwartzman topples Dominic Thiem in French Open epic","['Schwartzman reaches his first grand slam semi-final ']","['By the time Dominic Thiem and Diego Schwartzman had stopped hogging Court Philippe Chatrier night had fallen on Paris yet two matches were still to be played. To the 750 fans present, it didn’t matter. They were proud witnesses to a five‑hour psychodrama as Schwartzman eventually recovered to reach his first grand slam semi-final with a 7-6 (1), 5-7, 6-7 (6), 7-6 (5), 6-2 win against the US Open champion in 5hr 8min.', 'Schwartzman arrived on Chatrier all too aware of the opportunity at hand. While his momentum has been steadily building since he beat Rafael Nadal in Rome en route to his first Masters 1000 final, it has been clear for a while that the effort it took Thiem to win his first grand slam title last month would eventually catch up with him.', 'But even with his tank nearing empty, the Austrian’s spirit was majestic. In a match filled with nerves and endless exchanges, so often Thiem looked dead on his feet before roaring back to life. Schwartzman led 5-4 and 15-30 on Thiem’s serve in the second set before one of the worst misses of his career, then he failed to convert 5-3 leads in the third and fourth sets. As he felt the chances slipping away, he raged to his team.', '“In the second set and the third set I was out of my mind,” he said later, laughing. “I don’t know what the people are thinking about me in that time but I was crazy, screaming, talking to my coach. My coach was saying: ‘OK, play tennis, nothing else.’ I was so nervous because I saw the chance today and I didn’t take it in the second and in the third.”', 'Schwartzman may not have taken his opportunities but what defines him is the nerve he had to constantly pursue another. Two points away from defeat at 5-5 in the fourth-set tie-break, Schwartzman cracked a forehand on to the baseline and delicately placed a drop-volley winner. He took the tie-break and eventually the match.', '“We are friends,” Schwartzman said. “I have a lot of respect for him and that’s why this match is very, very important for me. Not just to play a good match, winning after five hours in Philippe Chatrier, first time. I’ve played few times five sets here and I never win. I think at the end, this night, I deserve to win. Come on.”', 'It concluded one of the great nights in years for Argentinian tennis after the world No 131 Nadia Podoroska shocked the No 3 seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals on her debut. She will face Iga Swiatek of Poland for a place in the final, marking just the second time since 1983 that two unseeded female players will compete in a grand slam semi-final.', 'This was already a Roland Garros for the little person, a two-week affirmation of the quality of competition away from the top of the men’s and women’s tours.', 'In Podoroska’s case, her success is the simple consequence of establishing the habit of winning, no matter where those wins occurred. After languishing outside the top 300 last year, this year she has compiled a 43-6 win-loss record from runs at tournaments with only $25,000 prize money, and now with victories at the elite level of the sport.', 'The 23-year-old later provided some sobering context to her success as she thought back to 2017, when she did not know if she would be able to continue her tennis career: “I had too many injuries,” she said. “I dropped my ranking. I had been like eight months out of the Tour. Then I didn’t have money to start playing tournaments. It was a very tough moment for me because I also changed all my team … I was a little bit, like, I didn’t know what to do.”', 'After winning a total of £232,604 prize money in her entire career, Podoroska has earned £386,862 for three weeks’ work. Reaching a Roland Garros semi-final is a personal dream and as the first Argentinian woman since Paola Suárez in 2004 to do so and in a country still nostalgic for the days of Gabriela Sabatini, it brings hope of a revival for South American women’s tennis.', 'However, lower‑ranked players have other priorities. Most of all, it will ensure that she can afford to conduct her career under the best possible conditions for the foreseeable future.']","French Open","Sport","2020-10-06",19.54,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71909724961f4f543cff9406752b5ed70b2799c/0_169_6040_3623/master/6040.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=6028721f87faac12ca00eb6671f497e8","Diego Schwartzman celebrates his victory against Dominic Thiem in their French Open match at Roland Garros.

  ["‘Do or die’: Australian cycling in limbo amid landmark reform","['Opposition to governance unification, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing nation-wide changes']","['Cycling in Australia faces unprecedented upheaval, with voting underway to unify the 19 separate entities responsible for the sport across the country. While the proposed restructuring is intended to facilitate better outcomes for elite and recreational cyclists, create “one voice” for advocacy and improve the sport’s financial position, resistance to the reform risks leaving cycling in disarray.', '“This is a real opportunity to create significant change for the better,” says Scott McGrory OAM, an Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist who now works as a race director. “Doing nothing is, quite simply, stupid. This is a ‘do or die’ moment for Australian cycling.”', 'In 2018, federal agency Sport Australia commissioned a governance review from Ernst & Young, with the support of the three national sporting organisations: Cycling Australia, BMX Australia and Mountain Bike Australia. The consultancy’s subsequent 128-page report identified that cycling is “fragmented in its structure, strategy and delivery”. The division of cycling into three disciplines, with two possessing constituent state and territory organisations, left individual entities with “few assets, restricted revenue opportunities and limited capacity”.', 'This year, the three NSOs proposed a complete unification, merging the three cycling disciplines, and the 19 constituent bodies, to form “AusCycling”. Among the suggested benefits of this model are a single racing licence, improved commercial and advocacy outcomes, and more resources as a result of efficiencies. Sport Australia has also promised A$2.5m if the merger proceeds.', '“This proposal is about making cycling as strong as it can be,” CA chief executive Steve Drake tells Guardian Australia. “I have always loved cycling – I want to see it prosper. This is the way it can.”', 'The three NSOs have promised that no jobs will be lost as a result of the merger, except the three chief executive roles. “It was never going to be possible for the CEO of, say, CA to be the CEO of AusCycling, because it would be a perceived as a CA takeover.” A new, external CEO will be sought to lead the unified organisation.', 'While staffing levels are expected to remain static or even grow, organisational synergies and improved negotiation power are expected to substantially improve the sport’s financial position. EY estimated an annual saving of about A$2m; the NSOs have indicated all savings will be reinvested.', '“We want to remove duplicated systems and avoid wasted effort,” says Drake. “At the moment we have 19 legal entities with 19 boards. While all directors are volunteers, for any board you have compliance requirements, audits etc – all of that takes time. That effort that is not needed. Collectively, we are a sport with turnover of about $28m across all the entities. Having 19 boards and over 100 directors does not make sense at our scale.”', 'Voting across the various national, state and territory entities is due to begin in the coming weeks. For the proposal to pass, 75% of MTBA’s individual members and six of the eight constituent bodies of CA and BMXA respectively must approve the unparalleled governance overhaul (each with a 75% majority of their own). Voting rights at state level are predominantly, although not universally, controlled by local clubs.', 'Not everyone is in favour of unification. Several states have expressed concerns with the plan. When the NSOs scheduled roadshows in September in Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Launceston, Perth and Mackay to discuss the proposal with stakeholders, Western Australia’s WestCycle suggested that they should not visit Perth. The NSOs went anyway. “It was a lively debate,” says Drake. WestCycle was contacted for comment.', 'This opposition, along with the high voting thresholds, risks derailing comprehensive, nation-wide governance reform. Drake admits the unification may proceed even without unanimity from state and territory bodies, or even with only two of the three NSOs.', '“There are lots of permutations,” he says. “But AusCycling would not come into operation until the second quarter of 2020, so there would be opportunity for a state body who voted no to change their view, or for constituent clubs from that state to join directly.”', 'If the proposal is approved, it is expected that unification will not be finalised until just months out from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Drake insists that Australia’s medal prospects are unaffected.', '“There is no risk of disruption to high performance, whether the unification proceeds or not,” Drake says. “We have been very mindful of keeping the high performance business away from the distraction of the process.”', 'Ahead of the critical voting period – which should conclude by 19 December – Drake is optimistic. “Any process of change can be challenging, but the level of support seems to be going up by the day,” he says. “People have been talking about something like this since 1994, and it has not yet happened. It will be a huge opportunity missed if we do not proceed.”', 'One stakeholder in favour of change is McGrory. “This is the best chance we have to create growth and opportunities for everyone that pedals a bike of any kind,” he says. “I only hope that anyone who is still uncertain at AusCycling can look at this with an open mind.”']","Cycling","Sport","2019-10-21",18,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99199856394ce57a8f27ace8df000f7a1856e6fb/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=22cf84ba5fce7c89f47f1f511a755bbb","Under the new proposed structure, road cycling will integrated with BMX and mountain biking under one administrative umbrella.

Instead he is expected to say he was pressured into ordering the Testogel at the request of Sutton.', 'O’Rourke told the tribunal that Dr Steve Peters, the head of medical at British Cycling, and Phil Burt, a physiotherapist, had given statements relating to bullying at the organisation.', 'However in his witness statement, Sutton, who is expected to give evidence next week, denied knowledge of the delivery and denied the testosterone was intended for him.', 'O’Rourke revealed she had recently received important information related to Sutton from three individuals and she was in the process of investigating it. She also said she had written to Collins as a matter of urgency.', '“We want to check that information out,” she said. “We can’t guarantee it is correct but when we have that information we must pursue it. Some relates to 2011, some to 2012 and some to what happened later at the DCMS.”', 'Collins said in response he had received the request only after parliament had been dissolved because of the general election and would not be able to help. “A committee is not able to release materials it has received that have not first been reported to the House,” he said.', 'Intriguingly, Freeman’s legal team also said they would consider making a section 35A legal application to an unnamed national newspaper, compelling them to hand over a document relating to the case it may hold, within 14 days. “I wouldn’t make an unfocused and wishy-washy vague application,” O’Rourke said. “I will name the legal person involved. I will give details of the approximate time it came into existence and I will name the author of the document. It will be made properly. We need to check on two or three sources first.”', 'O’Rourke said the section 35 was “a very wide power to search and seize” and the publication would have to hand over the document if requested.', 'Freeman was granted an application by the tribunal that he could be treated as a “vulnerable witness”. It means he will be shielded from the public gallery – where the media sit – by a screen when giving evidence and that he will also be shielded from Sutton if he is present.', 'Freeman has also been allowed to give evidence for no more than three hours a day and will be granted breaks in the morning and afternoon in addition to the lunch break.', 'The tribunal, which was adjourned until Friday morning, is expected to continue until mid-December.']","Team Ineos","Sport","2019-11-07",16.1,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fac5fe1a8f17818ef420cf30c264311efba9b4d/0_269_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=87fa910ac372caf0cc0580519a11af28","Richard Freeman at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester on Thursday.

Held on the online training platform Zwift, it was alleged that the Cornwall-based rider used a bot to give him an unfair advantage over his competitors.', '“The charge relates to manipulation of data before the finals,” said Chris Snook, senior PR manager at Zwift. “Jeffers used a bot to ride on multiple occasions at 2000 watts for distances of over 200km with a weight of 45kg. The ‘botting’ helped Jeffers unlock the Zwift Concept Z1 bike (commonly referred to as the Tron bike). It was deemed by British Cycling as an attempt to gain unfair advantage and was in breach of clause 5 of their disciplinary code.”', 'Jeffers has accepted his punishment, with second place finisher James Phillips awarded the title instead.', '“Defending fair play in our competitions is at the core of our responsibilities as a governing body,” said British Cycling integrity and compliance director Rod Findlay.', '“The fact that we have been able to investigate the offence and uphold the charge reflects the strength of our new disciplinary regulations and our determination to pursue misconduct.”']","Cycling","Sport","2019-10-04",19.5,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa43646e7118ec773f5ff66eca386df381895c3b/59_0_2212_1327/master/2212.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0c9b8f5eeffadcc31d59f8b52db7908b","Cameron Jeffers was stripped of his title following data manipulation charges.

  ["Downpours, forensic analysis and lots of pasta: on the team bus at the cycling worlds","['Guardian Australia was granted exclusive access to Australia’s male riders during the 2019 Road World Championships in Yorkshire']","['A decade ago, Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the pinnacle one-day race on the international cycling calendar: the UCI Road World Championships road race. Last week, Canberra’s Michael Matthews travelled to Yorkshire hoping to replicate that feat, having placed second in 2015 and third in 2017.', 'Treacherous English conditions turned the race into an epic, pushing the best riders in the world to breaking point. As Matthews and his seven Australian teammates fought for the rainbow jersey, Guardian Australia was along for the ride.', '6.10pm, Saturday: Police Treatment Centre, Harrogate', 'Australia’s technical director Brad McGee is holding court. In the lounge room of a grand rural residence converted into a rehabilitation centre for police, but occupied this week by several national teams, the Australian riders have gathered. A television screen in the corner shows a weather map, with heavy rain forecast. “Will I need a raft?” quips time trial world champion Rohan Dennis.', 'The banter stops as a late-arriving team member is chastised. The mood instantly switches, with McGee’s expression becoming stern. “Boys,” begins the former Olympic gold medallist. “Our objective is to win.” Over the next hour and a half, McGee, performance director Simon Jones, technical analyst Dr Eric Haakonssen and Australia’s eight riders forensically dissect the 285kms standing between them and glory. “Our ideal scenario is Michael Matthews sprinting to victory with seven guys leading him out,” says McGee. He pauses, and then chuckles: “That might not happen.”', 'Matthews is among the favourites, after recently outsprinting the other primary contenders in Canada. The Australians want to control the race from the start, and Dennis is told to ride hard on the front. “We’re going for the Team Sky look,” says Mitch Docker; the British outfit was infamous for its conspicuous dominance of the peloton. “It is important, visually,” he adds.', 'The discussion is lively, each rider offering their perspective and occasionally injecting humour. A major concern is information – unlike World Tour racing, national teams are not permitted to communicate by radio. Instead, Australia are deploying a traffic light system: at each feeding opportunity, staff members handing out bottles will wear coloured strips of material. Green means “all good”, yellow is an instruction to “be careful” and red indicates “crisis”, McGee explains.', 'Once the tactics are agreed, each rider is asked to summarise their role. Nathan Haas, Jack Haig and Simon Clarke are Matthews’ key lieutenants – it is imperative all three are still in play late in the race. “It is going to be us eight guys against 200,” says Haas. Focus eventually turns to Matthews, who has remained mostly silent. “Behind us will be mayhem,” he says. “I need all of you. It is going to be war.”', 'Finally, the meeting concludes. “Eat well, sleep better,” McGee instructs his charges. The menu is carbohydrate-heavy, featuring pasta, rice and potatoes. “Bon appetite.”', '6.50am, Sunday: team bus, en route to Leeds', 'The team rises early, with breakfast – toast, cereal, eggs and yet more pasta – served from 5.30am. The mood is subdued, with the riders mentally preparing for the toughest day of their season. As the bus departs for the start-line, word arrives that heavy rain overnight has necessitated a significant course change. Several climbs have been removed, with two additional laps of the final circuit around Harrogate added.', '“I think this is better,” Haas says. “It is a race we can control.” The others seem indifferent, although a few grumble about technical difficulties trying to update the course on their on-bike race computers. Once the commotion subsides, the riders return to their individual preparations – adding numbers to their kits, cleaning cleats, imbibing espressos from the bus’s coffee machine. Matthews speaks to his wife on FaceTime; Haig consults Haas about apartment renovation plans in Andorra.', 'The bus is greeted in Leeds by several family members – team captain Rory Sutherland’s two children have brought along an inflatable boxing kangaroo, wearing a world champion’s jersey. Technical director Jones, a Briton who has been credited with overhauling Australian cycling since joining from Team Sky, is delighted by the kangaroo and disappears with it onto the bus.', 'The team’s support staff, all employees of Australian-registered World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, busy themselves preparing bikes, bottles and nutritional supplies. Mitchelton-Scott provided the team bus, as many other World Tour teams have for their respective nations. The blend of club and country offers an odd aesthetic; Australia’s riders even have different helmets, reflecting the various sponsors of their trade teams.', 'McGee has a final chat with his squad, but there are no rousing words of motivation. “This does not change anything for us,” he says of the late course revision. “If anything it plays to our strengths.” Outside the bus, Jones, having returned the inflatable kangaroo, exudes an aura of calm. “There is no point telling them what to do,” he says. “They’re the ones who have to do it.”', 'The race rolls out 10 minutes behind schedule. McGee follows in the team car, while support staff scatter to different points of the route to offer bottles, feed bags and information. On the team bus, Jones has a live stream on one phone and is providing updates to the team WhatsApp group on another. Once an initial breakaway has formed, the commentator advises that, right on schedule, “Dennis moves to the front.” Jones reacts with a yell that reverberates around the bus: “Game on!”', 'The rain becomes heavier; the conditions are so bad that the helicopters which usually provide television footage have been grounded. “This is going to be such an epic day,” says Jones, with boyish enthusiasm. Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. “These blokes don’t care,” he says. “If it’s rainy, put a jacket on. If it’s windy, put your head down. These are hardened, battle-ready bike riders. The weather is not an issue.”', '12.57pm, Sunday: team car, on-course with 124kms to go', 'As the peloton enters the Harrogate circuit after four hours on-course, Dennis becomes the first Australian rider to abandon. “We are on track,” says McGee. “We completed the first half to plan, and the stage is set for a big finish.”', 'The team car convoy is ordered by UCI’s country rankings; Australia, in ninth, are well behind the back of the peloton. McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group – an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit – while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee’s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. “I’m just a little busy right now,” he offers apologetically.', 'The downpour is unceasing. “It has not stopped raining all day,” says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. “It is like a Tour de France day in July,” the coach observes. “Except it’s wet and they have their wellies on.”', 'More Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. “We are burning them in the right order.” Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. “Fuck,” he yells. Clarke’s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. “I got a hunger flat,” the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: “We’ve still got a few cards here.”', 'When Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians – Matthews and Haig – remain in the front group. The team’s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. “It is pretty much all mental from here – you just have to back yourself,” says McGee.', 'With three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at “be careful”. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. “It’s done,” he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. “We don’t have the numbers to bring it back.” McGee is visibly deflated. “There is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.”', 'Haig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies; Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. “How the mighty have fallen,” says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia’s medal hopes are extinguished.', 'The race is ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. “This sport, hey? Brilliant, isn’t it.” Matthews rolls across the line in 24th place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish.', '4.38pm, Sunday: team bus', 'Back on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. “That was,” Haas says, “an experience.” After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. “I tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,” he says.', 'Once the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year. The team take turns reflecting on their individual performances, in the order they exited the race, before others add commentary. Docker does not mince his words: “It was fucking brutal.”', 'The tone is broadly positive; the riders feel there was little they could have done differently. McGee encourages constructive criticism, listening intently as Clarke outlines the challenges they faced receiving food from the roadside. “Is there a way we can do that better next year?” he asks.', 'The team ponder how to overcome the conditions. “Every single person was cold,” says Haig. “It is not a coincidence that a Scandinavian won.” McGee suggests “there’s no preparing for a day like that”, but Jones is more pensive. “You can say it is down to the weather, but that’s merely a problem we haven’t solved,” he says. “Yet.”', 'Just like the prior evening, attention finally switches to Matthews. “I want to say thank you,” he says. “Last night we outlined a plan, and today we executed.” Matthews may not be a typical leader, but his teammates are transfixed. “It was miserable out there today, but I did not hear one person complain. We stuck together – how’s that for team culture?”', 'The other riders applaud, but Matthews is not finished. “We didn’t win, but we tried our best. Win, lose or draw, we have had an awesome day.”']","Cycling","Sport","2019-09-30",19,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b6e97a818bf3cfd69b3bc3c8dd43cb786e364e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=bd8d72155d381e77309ca2647ab9ded2","The Australian team get ready to leave the team bus in a sodden Yorkshire.

  ["Focus on team chemistry sets up Australia for cycling road worlds success","['Star rider Amanda Spratt says an opportunity earlier this year to spend time with the riders she will rely on in Yorkshire was invaluable']","['Should Australia’s Amanda Spratt win gold at the 2019 Road World Championships in England on Saturday, her mind will go from the hills of Yorkshire to the mountains of Livigno in the Italian Alps. Earlier this year, Spratt and the majority of her compatriots riding in the Women’s World Tour gathered in the picturesque ski resort town at the invitation of Cycling Australia.', 'It was an unusual invite. It was not on the eve of a major competition, nor did it bring together a group already selected for a particular race. The gathering had a higher purpose: to consolidate team chemistry and cohesion among a group of riders scattered across different trade teams and various locations.', '“We invited all female Australian riders competing in Europe, to come along, share, learn and be stronger as a group moving forward,” says Brad McGee, head coach of the national road cycling team. “The intention was simply to bring the athletes together. There was no real agenda about a particular campaign, but we wanted to strengthen those relationships.”', 'For Spratt, already appointed Australia’s lead rider for the 2019 Road World Championships road race after finishing second last year, the opportunity to spend time with the riders she will rely on in Yorkshire was invaluable. “The catch-up in Italy was great,” she says. “We spend so much of the year racing against each other, so to get us all together to hang out – that was a special feeling.”', 'The team camp in Livigno is Cycling Australia’s latest answer to a vexing question: how do you build a collective ethos among riders that typically spend just one week together in national team colours each year? In a sport where team work matters, and the difference between first and fourth could be a misunderstanding between colleagues at a decisive moment, engendering a sense of common purpose is more important than any marginal gain.', '“Physically we’re only together for short periods, but there are many ways to connect individuals during the year to become that team,” says McGee, a veteran of national squads on the track and road during his long professional career. “We maintain communication through Skype and WhatsApp, and encourage team leaders to stay connected with their likely support riders.”', 'Spratt, her mind set on gold this weekend, has been especially proactive. “Once the team was announced we had Skype meetings so everyone was clear on their roles,” she says. “We talked about how, with the riders we have, we can best win this world title, together. That is the focus – how can we maximise each other’s strengths.”', 'Team selection also plays a big role in building and maintaining team cohesion. “That can be by selecting some older mentor-type riders that carry the baton for that strong team culture,” says McGee. “Or by leaving riders out that have not been a value-add to that team culture. It is hard to build and very easy to destroy.”', 'When McGee was racing professionally in the early 2000s, close relationships with other Australians in the peloton were inevitable. “If you go back to my day, the total number of Aussies racing in Europe was low, so there was an automatic connection between us,” he says.', 'But the numerical rise of Australians on the World Tour, dotted across different trade teams, has required Cycling Australia to focus on team cohesion. “The larger rider base can dilute that connectivity and the awareness of other Aussies – more is not always better,” McGee says. “We have to create platforms and initiatives for the riders to bond, so that come world championships or Olympics, we have a connected team ready to deliver.”', 'The proliferation of Australian riders in Europe may have made this task more challenging, but the geographic distance from home does foster a natural bond. “We appreciate the sacrifices each of us have made to be over here,” says Spratt. “How far away we are from home, from our support networks – so we look out for each other.” That, says the rider, gives the Australians a competitive edge. “I think it brings the group a bit closer together than other national teams.”', 'Another advantage in the hunt for glory comes from the establishment of Mitchelton-Scott in 2011. Across the 15 men and women contesting the elite road races for Australia, one third currently ride for the Australian-registered World Tour outfit. Several more have spent time there in the past.', '“A big part of the effectiveness of the Australian cycling team is down to Mitchelton-Scott,” says McGee. “When I make my recommendations to select riders, I am not particularly concerned with which trade team they ride for. But we are very appreciative of the relationship between the Australian road cycling team and Mitchelton-Scott. Their level of commitment is fantastic.”', 'This weekend, both Spratt and the men’s team leader Michael Matthews are genuine contenders to clinch the rainbow jersey. If either succeeds, they will have Cycling Australia’s emphasis on team cohesion to thank. “When you have that team feeling and then you pull on the green and gold at worlds,” says Spratt, “you feel ready to smash yourself for each other.”']","Cycling","Sport","2019-09-27",2.57,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849143a78292e3e4680ec3510a3526ce94df3012/0_127_4480_2689/master/4480.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=f0fbe3b494343e6ca9ec69c47e51ac0a","Amanda Spratt is seeking to go one better than last year when she goes for gold in the road race.

  ["Rohan Dennis overcomes demons to defend rainbow stripes","['The Australian name-checked his sports psychologist after retaining his cycling world time trial title']","['When Rohan Dennis spectacularly abandoned the Tour de France this July, just one day before the time trial stage he was expected to win, focus immediately turned to the South Australian’s wellbeing. The 29-year-old has long been known for his fiery temperament, but to abandon the biggest race of the year mid-stage was something else entirely.', 'With Dennis and his team Bahrain-Merida remaining tight-lipped about the circumstances behind his withdrawal, some in the close-knit Australian cycling community became genuinely concerned for the 2018 world time trial champion. After 10 weeks away from the spotlight of competition, his scheduled appearance in national team colours at the Road World Championships to defend his rainbow jersey was much anticipated.', 'On Wednesday, he amply delivered. Triumph seemed assured from the moment Dennis rolled down the starter-ramp, calmly maintaining pace throughout and overhauling several riders along the way. But while his blistering victory in Yorkshire may have indicated that the recent turbulence did not impact his physical ability, the rider’s post-race comments revealed the internal battle he has faced.', '“It has been the toughest period of my career, it was almost breaking,” said Dennis. “I was reminding myself today was all in my head.”', 'The Australian even name-checked his sports psychologist, David Spindler, in the post-race interviews. Spindler collected Dennis from the airport after he returned home from the Tour de France in the midst of the furore, and has worked closely with him ever since. “I mean physically I have always had it, but it was always the negativity in my head thinking not the positive things.” On Wednesday, Dennis overcame those demons.', 'His assured victory in Harrogate was a powerful reminder that, presently, no one on the planet has the same ability to race against the clock. After years of coming close to that crown, only to be felled by mishap or misadventure, Dennis beat defending time trial champion Tom Dumoulin last year in Innsbruck by over a minute. Twelve months later, he again put more than a minute into his nearest rival, this time teenage prodigy Remco Evenepoel.', 'Dennis’s rainbow stripes will buoy the Australian national team as they head into a big weekend of action. After finishing second in 2018, Amanda Spratt is a prime contender in the women’s road race on Saturday, in what shapes up to be an enthralling battle between the powerhouse Australian and Dutch teams.', 'On Sunday, Michael Matthews is among a group of favoured riders likely to be in the final selection in the men’s 285km epic. Dennis’s ride in the time trial offers hope that he can be an important support player for Matthews, alongside veteran Simon Clarke and climber Jack Haig.', 'Once the Road World Championships have concluded, Dennis will turn his mind to 2020. His future at Bahrain-Merida is unclear. He has recently indicated he intends to see out his contract, which runs through to 2020. But Dennis rode an unmarked bike on Wednesday – it is believed the dispute which saw him leave the Tour de France related to equipment.', 'Whichever trade team Dennis is riding for in 2020, his performance in Yorkshire augurs well for the Tokyo Olympics. The Australian’s dominant showing, in the face of such a challenging recent period, suggests that the work of psychologist Spindler is paying dividends. If Dennis can head to Tokyo next July without any of the distractions that have plagued him this year, he will be a strong favourite to claim Olympic time trial gold.']","Cycling","Sport","2019-09-26",1.27,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3e1f3e06b0650c0c218c26fe14e09e4e3394e6/0_182_3362_2018/master/3362.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e612a3970fa04a1490077b5e9190c8f6","Rohan Dennis is all smiles after winning the men’s time trial at the Road World Championships.

On Wednesday he appeared at the start line in Northallerton with a bike that did not appear to be team issue, having not raced since July, with a point to prove.', 'The 29-year-old from Adelaide was 19sec faster than Evenepoel at the first time check after 16.7km, but gained time substantially from then on, moving more than one minute clear at the second check close to Fountains Abbey at 37km. The scale of his ride was simply measured: he overhauled the recent Vuelta a España winner Primoz Roglic, who had started three minutes ahead, after just 31 of the 50km, on a particularly technical and demanding part of the course.', 'The Slovenian raced him from there to the finish line but the point had been made: Dennis was head and shoulders clear of the rest. “It’s been a tough year, there has been a lot of talk since the Tour de France about what I am doing,” said Dennis. “I really wanted to come here in my best shape to show that I haven’t hung my bike up. I’ve still got a lot to give the sport.”', 'As for Evenepoel, this result continued a vertiginous trajectory of improvement that has made him the hottest property in professional cycling. It comes at the end of his first professional season, in which he has gone straight from the junior ranks to World Tour to win the European time trial title and the San Sebastian Classic; it bodes well for his debut in the elite road race on Sunday.', 'The diminutive youngster rode a flawless race – cool headed enough to freewheel briefly to pull up an aerodynamic sock immediately after he left the start ramp – and surviving a near miss approaching Masham when he changed course to avoid a cat’s eye on a left-hand bend, and came close to piling into the parapet of a bridge. He was more fortunate than his fellow Belgians Yves Lampaert and Victor Campenaerts – both his senior in years and experience – both of whom crashed late on.', 'The bronze medal went to the Italian Filippo Ganna, while the specialist from Essex, Alex Dowsett, managed a creditable fifth place having paced his effort perfectly to gain significant ground in the second half of the race. But Ganna and the rest were all around two minutes or more behind Dennis; the enigmatic Australian and the precocious Belgian were in a class of their own.', 'Over a course that looped west then south from Northallerton, and in conditions that were positively benign compared to the monsoon rain of Tuesday, the early pace was set by the Scot John Archibald. Aged 28, the brother of the Olympic medallist Katie Archibald has proved his ability as a pursuiter on the track and had been part of the Great Britain team that had won bronze in Sunday’s mixed relay, but this was new territory for him. It raised the question: should he have been selected as of right ahead of the Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, whose late withdrawal paved the way for his entry to the race.', 'On Thursday, the road races begin, with the junior men racing over a course that starts in Richmond and heads west through the Yorkshire Dales before passing Bolton Abbey to return into Harrogate for three laps of the tricky finish circuit. Sam Watson heads a British sextet in a race in which no British rider has ever taken a medal.']","Cycling","Sport","2019-09-25",17.16,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507576bd4500b968037f67ac14c0d8472683378a/8_157_3492_2209/master/3492.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a193b6ba6988640b9438954f04a7045d","Rohan Dennis celebrates winning the Road World Championships men’s individual time trial.

Shifting the centrepiece of the cycling calendar will involve a delicate juggling act with the other two Grand Tours, the Vuelta a España and the world road championships, and the five “monument” one-day Classics all jostling for space at the end of the season when it is hoped that major sports events in Europe will resume.', 'The news was greeted with delight by the four-times champion Chris Froome, who confirmed this week that he has largely recovered from the accident that cost him a ride in the 2019 race. “The news many of us have been waiting for,” he said through Twitter. “Some light at the end of the tunnel – assuming all goes well.” Apart from during the two world wars, the Tour has never been cancelled, and many in France will see plans for its resumption as a sign that life may return to normal after the coronavirus pandemic.', '“I was glad to hear that the Tour will take place at a later date,” said the French cyclist Julian Alaphilippe. “There may be fewer people watching but it will still be a huge fête with lots of joy and motivation.” The Tour will stick to the route scheduled from 27 June, starting in Nice, heading west through the Massif Central to the Pyrenees before looping back to the Alps.', '“Holding this event in the best conditions possible is judged essential given its central place in cycling’s economy and its exposure, in particular for the teams that benefit on this occasion from unparalleled visibility,” said a statement from the Union Cycliste Internationale. A rejigged calendar for the UCI Women’s WorldTour is expected by 15 May, with all WorldTour events now cancelled until 1 August.', 'The UCI also confirmed that the road world championships in Switzerland will take place immediately after the Tour. The men’s elite time trial title is currently scheduled for 20 September and will clash with the Tour finish in Paris, potentially creating a dilemma for riders who might target both events such as Froome and Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands. However, the men’s elite road race is pencilled in for 27 September.', 'The official release from the UCI said that both the Giro and the Vuelta would take place after the world championships; initial signs are that the Giro may be moved to October, with the Vuelta in November.', 'National road race championships were scheduled for the weekend of 20-21 June, and will – presumably depending on the situation in individual countries – be held on the weekend of 22-23 August.

That made the postponement of the Tour inevitable, and the need for at least some preparation events for the 22-day race meant that rescheduling until the end of July would not have been practical.', 'There was an initial suggestion shortly after France entered lockdown that the Tour might be held “behind closed doors” with strict limitations on spectator numbers, but this was not warmly received by officials in the stage towns who pay for starts and finishes on the understanding that large numbers of fans will bring in sizeable revenue.', 'Officials from the Tour’s stage towns – around 50 of them according to one source – were called on Tuesday to discuss the move prior to a teleconference on Wednesday morning involving the race organisers, teams and the UCI.', 'The new schedule should give time to the Tour’s cyclists to get out on their home roads to train as lockdowns are lifted, because at present some – in the UK and Belgium for example – can ride on the road whereas this is banned in France, Spain and Italy. “It’s the best solution to allow the riders to get their act together,” said the Groupama-FDJ team manager, Marc Madiot. “Cycling needs the Tour but the Tour needs cyclists who are in decent condition.”']","Tour de France","Sport","2020-04-15",12.54,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1bfa21e745d00313462fc46bddd0656111b1b6/0_94_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=37d6a1e6e51c3adc0a23c1b2fa875dfa","Egan Bernal wearing the overall leader’s yellow jersey, in action in front of the Arc de Triomphe last year at the conclusion to the Tour de France.

Ajinkya Rahane followed soon after, Joe Root continuing his recent impression of complete faultlessness by making a brilliant left-handed diving grab at cover.', 'Bess said: “I think I’m bowling really well at the moment but more important than anything it’s about the collective. We’ve taken six today and I think it’s set up the game nicely. We’ve seen it start to spin and it’s only going to do more. We’re pretty close to a new ball and I think we’re in a great place at the moment.”', 'Kohli’s wicket was more precious still because of the planning that went into it, with Bess filmed leaving the field at lunch in discussion with Rory Burns, miming precisely the stroke into which he would later fatefully tempt India’s captain.', '“It was a special dismissal I think more for what my process was,” he said. “It’s not about bowling that magic ball, it’s about smashing in 10, 15 balls in a good area and then something will happen.', '“ It’s special because of who he is, and I think he’s phenomenal, a world-class player. But it’s more what I’m learning, what I’m doing, that is getting me to that point. But I don’t want to think about it too much, we’re in the middle of a game and we’ve got so much to work on. We got him as a team, and we’ll have to try to get him out next innings.”', 'With India at one stage 73 for four, England’s position could have been better still had Rishabh Pant not hit a barnstorming 91 off 88 balls before skying a shot to deep cover, while Cheteshwar Pujara was providing excellent support before his freak dismissal, when the ball clipped the shoulder of Ollie Pope at short leg and looped gently to Rory Burns at midwicket.', '“You know what, it’s out.

  ["Joe Root's England Test century: our writers on his greatest moments","['As Root walks out for his 100th Test, Guardian cricket writers pick their favourite moment from his first 99']","['It’s something of a curiosity that Root’s 110 against South Africa at the Wanderers is rarely mentioned among the best of his 19 Test centuries. Maybe Stuart Broad, who sealed the series on the third day with an electric six for 17, is to blame.', 'Either way, it’s the innings that comes to my mind when picturing Root at his celestial best; you know, the frictionless, impish version of Root where the shots sound so crisp and footwork looks ready to take on Blackpool week in Strictly.', 'Batting was not easy under moody skies on the highveld either. Some 12 wickets had fallen without a half-century on the board by the time he stepped out into the Bullring with England in a bit of strife. And yet he transcended the bouncy, result-driven pitch through an audacious counterattack alongside Ben Stokes.', 'Mike Selvey, sat alongside me, labelled it “a technical masterpiece” when chronicling the array of high-elbowed drives and daring uppercuts, while Root simply called it “a relief”. You see, it had ended a run of five unconverted half-centuries and thus ensured that this particular issue never resurfaced again … oh. Ali Martin', 'It was a December day in Nagpur that England, under new captain Alastair Cook, first took a punt on Joe Root. Just 21 and puppy-powered, he was plucked for the No 6 spot ahead of Samit Patel – seemingly from nowhere. But reports from the Lions were rosy and he’d been given two extra-long, prove-yourself nets before his selection. The Nagpur pitch was deliberately dead: slow and uneven, and Root came in with England unsteady at 119 for four. He gorgeously drove Piyush Chawla through the covers for three, and from that point onwards was all soft hands and preternatural calm – 73 in 229 balls and 289 minutes of happy concentration. Kevin Pietersen, standing at the other end, mused: “You can never judge a batsman after just a couple of hours at the crease, but he showed signs that he could have a good Test career.” Tanya Aldred', 'England have just regained the Ashes at Trent Bridge in 2015, and as Sky’s Ian Ward infiltrates the victorious dressing room, he is confronted by Root in a rubber mask, impersonating Bob Willis. “Well, it wasn’t a patch on my day, was it?” Root whines, to peals of laughter from his teammates. And it’s a reminder that for all his diligently compiled runs and solemn leadership, one of Root’s most appealing qualities is his impish, bubble-pricking sense of humour.', 'We could have chosen numerous other examples: the time Stuart Broad chased him across the field after having his trousers pulled down, the time Root dissolved into giggles during an Ashes Test after Alastair Cook had been hit in the whatnots. It’s a side of Root we’ve seen less over the years – perhaps understandably. But it also strikes at one of Test cricket’s essential truths: sometimes, it helps if you can laugh at it. Jonathan Liew', 'Five months after his Test debut Root was the talk of English cricket going into the home series against New Zealand, having scored a six-and-a-quarter-hour 179 against them for England Lions in a warm-up match, and he went into his first ever game at Lord’s having scored 646 runs in his previous four first-class innings and with Andy Flower warning that “everyone should keep a little calm about his prospects”. In England’s second knock both openers, Alastair Cook and Nick Compton, were out with the score on 36 and Root, promoted up the order because Ian Bell had flu, joined Jonathan Trott, nearly 10 years his senior, with England’s lead at 61 and the match delicately poised, and took charge. His 71 was not perfect – there was some particularly jittery running (the Kiwi keeper BJ Watling injured a knee trying to run him out) but it was startlingly mature and set up a comfortable victory, completed when Anderson and Broad skittled the Kiwis for 68. Root’s maiden century came in his next Test innings, at Headingley a week later. Simon Burnton', 'Root’s first Test as captain, day one at Lord’s: the perfect stage, the perfect knock, and a moment of era-forging ignition. Except, not quite. Or at least, not quite yet. Skip forward four years from this magnificently fluent innings to the recent back-to-back daddies against Sri Lanka and you might imagine the 43 Tests in between had been a tale of unbroken triumph. In reality things have been harder. After Lord’s Root had 12 hundreds in 54 Tests and averaged 53.80. In the next 43 he added five hundreds, just two at home, and at times looked to have lost that vital sense of fun and urgency in his batting, the same fluent, joyful quality that sent him surging from a hundred to 190 in 84 balls against a high class South Africa attack. The early captain’s bloom of Lord’s 2017 has yet to be fully cashed in. But there was an ominously frisky look to his batting in Sri Lanka. Root is only just 30. This might be the start of Act Two. Barney Ronay', 'During the third Test against West Indies in St Lucia in 2019, Shannon Gabriel took exception to the way Root was looking at him. “Why are you smiling at me?” Gabriel said. “Do you like boys?” Root, quiet but firm, replied: “Don’t use it as an insult – there’s nothing wrong with being gay.” You wish it didn’t need saying. But it did, and even more depressingly, it still does.', 'Homosexuality is still a criminal offence in the majority of the Test-playing nations. Which might be why, to this day, only one male international cricketer has come out as gay during his career. Comments such as Gabriel’s don’t help (and he’s not the only one, two Australian internationals were punished for using homophobic slurs around that time, too). Comments such as Root’s do. It was a fine, quick, clear bit of moral leadership from a man a lot of people said was too immature to make a good captain.

For the opening match, which starts on Friday, that position is now likely to be taken by Dan Lawrence, with Ollie Pope coming straight into the side after his recovery from injury.', '“There’s a number of different combinations we can go with. I think that’s the exciting part of it – we’ve now got a number of guys who can bat in different positions,” said Root. “I think everything’s on the table as far as selection is concerned, we’ll weigh everything up when we get to the ground, look at the conditions, look at the surface again, and try to have real clarity going into the game.”', 'Though England arrive having won their last five away Tests, and bolstered by the returns of Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes, both rested for the recent series in Sri Lanka and reported by their captain to be in fine form in training, India’s home record is formidable. They have won 28 of their 34 home Tests since England won their series there in 2012, and only lost a single match to Australia four years ago.', '“We’re very realistic about where we are as a team, how we’re slowly improving over a period of time. We know this is going to be a huge challenge for us but we’re relishing that challenge, we’re looking forward to it,” said Root.', 'Root made his Test debut on that successful tour of India in 2012, playing a single match a few days before his 22nd birthday with his opponents including his opposite number now, Virat Kohli. Like India themselves in Australia much more recently England had lost the first match before coming back to win the series.', '“I would say in 2012 there was complacency on our part,” Kohli said on Thursday. “I think it was England who played better cricket and came back strongly, and it was similar with us in Australia. I don’t think Australia let up as much as we were determined to come back and overpowered their plans and their determination.”', 'India’s series victory in Australia, achieved despite a succession of injuries to senior players and with Kohli himself playing only once before returning home to be present for the birth of his first child, means they come into this series with unusually inflated confidence even for a side so used to success at home.', '“The team is in a really good space, everyone is really motivated to do well,” Kohli said. “If you look at our journey in the last couple of years, apart from in [last year’s two-Test series in] New Zealand where we weren’t in the contest as all, I think as a Test side we have been playing really good cricket. The motivation is to understand why we got the results and not get too carried away by the emotion or excitement of it all. The chat on day one by the whole team was to move on and focus on the next game.

Of the 14 players to reach three-figures previously – a list that includes Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen and Graham Gooch – none did so with more than Root’s current tally of 8,249 runs.', 'The 30-year-old, whose side will wear black armbands to honour the late Captain Sir Tom Moore, said: “There are some fantastic players among those and many I’ve looked up to and admired for many years. It’s been amazing also to have shared a dressing room with a number of them as well.', '“I hope it’s not near the end. I still feel like there’s a lot left in me at the moment and there’s certainly a burning desire to keep going and play as long as I can.', '“I look back over the last nine years and I’m in a very different place now to when I first came into the team so who knows what the future holds. For now I’m just very excited about playing as much as I can and giving as much to the team as possible.”', 'This is a defining year for Root’s side and one that culminates in an attempt to reclaim the Ashes from Australia.

When I came into the team in 2012 I played a very small part in that amazing series. I don’t think at the time I appreciated how hard it is to win in these conditions.', '“To get the opportunity to play India off the back of them beating Australia in Australia – what a scalp that would be for us. There will be more pressure on them than us – they have an expectation to uphold that record in their conditions.', '“It’s a big one, we’re all aware of that because it’s a very difficult place to come and win. But that doesn’t scare us and it shouldn’t. We certainly have the tools to win these four games.

But while the repeat nature of the injury has seen England take a cautious approach, with Pope having continued his rehabilitation on the sidelines in Sri Lanka while the newcomer Dan Lawrence was blooded, there is growing expectation he could be ready to resume his role at No 6 as early as this week in Chennai.', 'This could yet hinge on whether Ben Stokes is able to play as an all-rounder following a two-month break from cricket; if not, then England may find they need to bat wicketkeeper Jos Buttler at No 6 and bring in Chris Woakes as a third seam option alongside Jofra Archer and one of either Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson.', 'Stokes, who landed in India early along with Archer and Rory Burns, has already been bowling in the nets and was joined by the remainder of the squad on Tuesday after they completed six days of isolation in their hotel rooms. Pope batted and played a full part in fielding drills, meaning he could be added to the main squad this week. Both Stokes and Archer have not played for England since the Twenty20 series in South Africa before Christmas, a tour which ended when the one-day series was aborted due to an outbreak of Covid-19 in the team hotel.', 'Archer spent 87 days in the bubble during the last home summer and though refreshed from the break, part of which was spent in Barbados, the 25-year-old feels confident to approach the head coach, Chris Silverwood, should problems arise.', 'Speaking after training, Archer said: “Funnily enough, I have looked at the schedule today and all I can say is it is going to be a very long year. Managing your body is going to be really important. Anyone criticising us has never been in the bubble. We have been in a bubble for months, we have been in here for almost a year now. I think we have to go in and out because humans are social people. It starts to get hard if you are not having a great game or not feeling good with your cricket because there is nowhere to go.', '“If it does get too overbearing it is okay to say that. I think Spoons [Silverwood] has said already that if you have a problem come and tell him but at the moment I am good to go until at least July.”', 'The pandemic put paid to another series on Tuesday with Australia pulling out of a proposed three-Test visit to South Africa in March due to what Cricket Australia’s interim chief executive, Nick Hockley, called “an unacceptable level of health and safety risk to our players, support staff and the community”.', 'As well as angering Cricket South Africa – the director of cricket, Graeme Smith, said he was “extremely disappointed by the decision” – it has meant New Zealand qualify for June’s inaugural ICC World Test Championship final in England in June. India are clear favourites to join them, with England needing to win three of the four Tests to take their place and Australia still not entirely out of contention.']","England in India 2020-21","Sport","2021-02-02",17.24,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84405c8f12420597f0c2ae0c12a873f9803ef262/120_101_2836_1702/master/2836.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=c9becaba97c15bbd83527f00b757a1a1","Ollie Pope dislocated his left shoulder in the third and final Test against Pakistan last summer and has not played since.

', 'The deal represents a huge coup for Channel 4, which submitted its bid to Star Sports last week – one described as “compelling” by insiders due to the free-to-air aspect – but still feared being gazumped by a late move from Sky or BT Sport. This did not materialise, however, although one of the two subscription broadcasters could still come on board, with the Star-Channel 4 deal understood to be agreed on a non-exclusive basis that allows additional satellite and digital partners.', 'While three of the four Tests start at 4am in the UK – the third Test is a day-night match with a 9am start – the national lockdown could mean big audience numbers generated by England and India supporters, as well as potential newcomers.', 'Channel 4 attracted a peak of 8.4m viewers when it last showed Test cricket in 2005 and a one-off deal with Sky to share the 2019 World Cup final brought in 15.4m over the course of the day. Research by the England and Wales Cricket Board suggested a third of this audience was watching cricket for the first time.', 'Asked on Tuesday whether a potentially increased audience size would appeal, the England fast bowler Jofra Archer said: “Yes. Mostly the kids as well, because any way you can inspire helps the next generation. Hopefully it goes through. It would be good to have back on the huge platform. It’s probably one of the few live sports on at the moment apart from football. So I guess a lot of people will be watching.”', 'Channel 4 is yet to officially confirm the arrangement with the contract still to be signed but has spent the past week sounding out pundits for studio work.

Only a shortage of time to arrange ticketing has prevented doors being open when the teams’ first meeting gets under way on Friday.', 'Though the outcome of discussions between the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association have not yet been made public, a TNCA official told the Press Trust of India agency on Monday that the public would be permitted.', '“It has been decided by the BCCI and TNCA to allow 50% spectators for the second Test by following all safety protocols,” the official said. “There is little time to make arrangements for spectators’ entry for the first Test so crowds cannot be allowed. Though the gap between the first two Tests is only three days, we are confident that arrangements can be made for fans in the second Test.”', 'TNCA members and journalists may be allowed at the first Test, while clearance has already been given for spectators to attend the third and fourth matches, which will be played at the 110,000-capacity Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad. Though they can expect a hostile atmosphere, the development was immediately welcomed by England’s players.', '“If it’s safe then great, obviously we’d love to play in front of crowds as soon as possible,” said Jack Leach. “Definitely we want to play in front of crowds, but obviously we don’t want to be adding to a problem which is affecting the whole world.”', 'Following illness and injury, Leach returned after a 14-month absence from Test cricket to contribute a stream of second-innings wickets to England’s series victory in Sri Lanka last month, but he has admitted that further improvement will be required if he is to flourish in India against the team he considers “probably on paper the best in the world”.', 'Having returned no positive Covid tests on Sunday, the team will be released from quarantine to train on Tuesday for the first time since their arrival in India. The six days spent in his hotel room – “I’ve done some reflecting, I’ve bowled a few in the mirror” – has been a relatively brief pause in what has been a stop-start couple of years for Leach, who at the age of 29 is preparing for his 13th Test.', '“It’s been a long time not playing, and in that time I did a lot of work to try to become, I guess, the bowler that I want to be. I feel like it’s all in there, I just need to bring it out now. I feel I’m going in the right direction. India are obviously a great side and they’ve got all bases covered. I wouldn’t want to have too many assumptions, but I know if I get myself right and in the right headspace and bowling how I can then I can be effective.”', 'Leach’s confidence has been freshly boosted by his impact in Sri Lanka, even if he was not completely satisfied with his performances there. “I’m somebody who’s never happy, and I think there’s more improvement from me to come. I feel like the way the ball came out wasn’t exactly how I’d like it, but I have to accept that I haven’t had much cricket in recent times. The boys played some great cricket, it was nice to be part of that and make a contribution, but I feel like I’ve got more to offer.”', 'He may be helped by the pitches in India, even if the quality of batsmen he will be facing is daunting. “I feel it’s just a great opportunity for all of us to test ourselves against what on paper’s probably the best side in the world,” Leach said. “To do it here – it’s my first time in India – this is the dream. It’s a fantastic opportunity and after missing cricket you have to remember to really enjoy and cherish these moments.”', 'Channel 4 have bid for broadcasting rights in the UK, which would make the series the first Tests to be broadcast on terrestrial TV since the 2005 Ashes.

I think it will very much be a case of Jos is No 1.', '“After getting dropped last time, you don’t really know if you’re gonna play again or get another chance to wear the shirt so I think I am approaching it more as I’ve got a potential chance to play more Tests for England and see where it goes.', '“I did expect to get more of a run [in the Test team previously]. I guess it’s tricky to control your emotions in that sense. I got pretty high with all the things going on then and it gets taken away from you because I didn’t get runs in the West Indies.', '“I know the strength of competition with the keepers is so high, so there are going to be times I’m not playing. That’s something I have to accept and be at peace with. If I do get a chance at any stage just try to enjoy it and embrace it.” ', 'Jack Russell recently told the Cricketer magazine that Foakes is “the most naturally gifted wicketkeeper in the world” when stood up to the stumps but the man himself, while flattered by the praise from a former master, is not getting carried away.', '“Anything like that is amazing to hear from someone like [Russell],” said Foakes. “But as a player, I guess I’m quite critical. I find it difficult to praise myself, so everything I do I’m trying to improve and be as good as I can.', '“I really struggle to see the positives or let those comments in. It’s just trying to not mess up basically, do the best job I can and put the work in.” ', 'Not that his batting is shabby, either. Of all the England players to make their Test debut since Joe Root in 2012, only Haseeb Hameed (on the India tour in 2016) and Foakes average more than 40. It begs the question as to whether a specialist batsman who started so brightly would have got longer, not that the man himself is looking into this.', 'Foakes said: “I am a keeper and in terms of going down the route of a specialist batter, there are other guys ahead of me.

It followed a summer of three centuries and nearly 1,000 first-class runs for Yorkshire, plus some impressive work against spin during A tours to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.', 'Nine years from the endorsement that led to Root’s initial Test call-up – and the subsequent debut in Nagpur as Alastair Cook’s side sealed a historic 2-1 series victory – Thorpe is full of praise for a cricketer who heads into Friday’s much-anticipated first Test at Chennai with 99 caps in the bag.', '“To play 100 Test matches is no mean feat. Joe and his family will be very proud,” said Thorpe, himself one of 14 England cricketers in this elite club andthe national team’s assistant coach and batting lead on tour.', '“It is a real achievement because of the longevity of it. You need a good sense of humour to play that amount of cricket, because you will experience highs but there will be some moments in there where you have your lows.', '“You have to show a bit of character and resilience, keep adapting and sometimes you will have to tinker with your technique, and you have to manage all of that.”', 'Root could scarcely wish to be in better form before the four-match series, even if a six-day quarantine leaves England with only three days of nets beforehand, after amassing 426 runs during the 2-0 win in Sri Lanka and chalking up centuries in successive Tests for the first time in his career.', 'According to Thorpe, who played exactly 100 Tests himself as a compact and stylish left-hander who scored more than 7,000 runs, that return was a case of the 30-year-old looking to set an example to his players at the start of a potentially career-defining 12 months, as well as being a product of his ability to adapt.', 'Thorpe said: “His work ethic is fantastic and he’s also kept his love for the game which is so important. Joe has always remained humble, he is a great student of the game and loves learning.', '“What I saw early on, and I was fortunate enough to see some of his early games, was character. And he certainly tried to work things out for himself. He loves watching other people play and he is someone who has a great hunger to score runs.”', 'England cannot rely on the blade of one batsman, however, and must deliver as a collective if they are to prevail against Virat Kohli’s side. And though there has been an emphasis on overcoming turning tracks during this subcontinental winter, in the past two years India’s seamers have 59 wickets at home, compared to 37 with spin.', 'Thorpe added: “There’s a hell of a lot of hard cricket ahead of us and we’re not under any illusions about that. The one thing about the Indian bowling attack as well is that it’s not just about spin. Their seam attack also is strong. We [must not] get sidetracked completely by the spin side of things.”', 'How supporters back in the UK will be able to watch the series remains up in the air, with rights holders Star Sports still in negotiations with potential broadcasters over a tour of four Tests, five Twenty20s and three ODIs that they value in the region of £20million.', 'Sky, BT and Channel 4 are all understood to be in the mix here – the latter pair possibly sharing coverage in some capacity, in what would be the first free-to-air Test cricket in the UK since 2005 – but a final deal may not be struck until the 11th hour.']","England cricket team","Sport","2021-01-29",15.41,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ddcfc06a2aadd1dd58c6bc7f6398b7aaacc902/0_94_5021_3013/master/5021.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a2242f3f2f31bfd3c792f73fb9b852c5","Joe Root (left) with England batting coach Graham Thorpe.

  ["Rory Burns back for England and prepared for life in the bubble","['The opener is in India armed with a fresh perspective thanks to his baby daughter and a new interest in psychology']","['After missing the Sri Lanka series to be present for the birth of his first child, Rory Burns is quarantining in India, where England’s first Test starts next Friday, and preparing to return to the biosecure bubble in which he struggled off and, at times, on the field. The opener is now armed with a few new tools to ensure he does not become overwhelmed by total immersion in cricket.', 'After last summer, when his most impressive series on home soil – averaging 43.82 runs against West Indies – segued into his worst – averaging five against Pakistan – Burns admitted the bubble was “not something I personally enjoyed that much” and that he “found that you couldn’t get away from cricket”, something not helped by the players living at the ground, as they were at Manchester and Southampton.', 'He starts 2021, helped in part by the arrival of his daughter, Cora, with a different focus. “We’re not overlooking a cricket ground and that’s a massive positive,” he says from his hotel room, where his practice has been limited to shadow-batting in front of a mirror.', '“I’ll just be proactively doing things outside the game. It helps to keep me fresh and get the mind away from cricket, so I don’t just sit there and stew about the game completely. I’ve started a short course in psychology and that’s probably going to take up a bit of my time, to just write things down and get my headspace right away from the game. And I’ve had a break, sort of refreshment, and the new perspective that fatherhood brings.”', 'The psychology course is potentially a first step towards a future career for the 30-year-old. “It’s always been an interest of mine,” he says. “I’m just seeing whether I’ve got a real interest in it that’s worth pursuing further, dipping my toe in to see if it’s worth taking a degree and then going down that route.” ', 'First he must refocus on cricket, having not had any first-class action since September. England are on a run of five successive away Test victories, all of which have been without Burns, who missed the end of the tour in South Africa last winter after damaging ligaments in a training-ground football kickabout and the start of this winter’s travels on paternity leave.', '“It’s been a bit of a stop-start year, but it’s been a stop-start year for everyone,” Burns says. “Covid probably lent itself to that as well. There are extenuating factors. ', '“I’m jumping to get back into work and back into business. I can’t wait to get going. I’ve got a bat out and I’m shadow-batting in the mirror behind me. I’ve not gone the full Steve Smith and whited up yet, but it’s coming down all right so hopefully that translates.”', 'In Burns’s absence, Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley opened the batting in Sri Lanka, the former, after an outstanding 2020, averaging 8.75 in the two Tests and reaching double figures once, while Sibley admitted he “had a bit of a stinker in the series” before scoring a crucial if slightly fortunate unbeaten 56 to end it on a high.', '“It’s a strange feeling,” says Burns of his decision to step away from the side, “but if you’re going to miss it for anything the birth of your first child is probably one thing that you would do it for. It’s double-edged but I wouldn’t have changed my decision at any stage.', '“I got to see something pretty impressive from my wife, so I was happy about that. It’s a pretty momentous occasion, isn’t it? I just feel very privileged that I’ve been able to have a child. She makes me emotional just to look at her. The fact I’ve got a little girl to play my cricket for now, as well as everything else, is a nice little perspective change.”']","England cricket team","Sport","2021-01-28",15.56,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78b7388392d2acd07e6dcd5ee3c9e0206701d76/1078_844_1970_1182/master/1970.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4fca1b38735c94714d1e102ac222575c","Rory Burns has been on paternity leave but returns for England’s series in India.

  ["Chris Silverwood stands by England's touring rotation policy","['Head coach urges supporters to show understanding', '‘It’s not easy. We’ve got to look after our people’']","['Chris Silverwood has asked England supporters to understand the need for key players to miss Tests as the head coach and his fellow selectors grapple with a uniquely congested winter that is bookended by two Indian Premier League tournaments.', 'Jonny Bairstow, Mark Wood and Sam Curran are due to head home to rest following the 2-0 win in Sri Lanka, while Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, already quarantining in Chennai ahead of the first Test starting next week, missed that initial series to take their allotted break.', 'With Bairstow considered one of the better players of spin but not back until the third of the four Tests in India, and the wicketkeeper Jos Buttler flying home after the first and not returning until the white-ball leg of the tour, England will be under strength against a side who have lost just once in their past 35 home Tests.', 'Asked about the much-debated rotation policy, Silverwood replied: “I stand by it. We’ve got to look after our people. We’re spending a lot of time locked in hotel rooms inside bio-secure bubbles and it’s not easy. It’s good that we’re being proactive and looking after people. I’m perfectly happy with the system.”', 'This is a winter like no other, it must be said. The pandemic has both packed the schedule – the Sri Lanka tour was meant to be last March – and thrown up additional challenges to player welfare through its restrictive bubble lifestyle, as highlighted by England’s issues in South Africa before Christmas.', 'Other than Wood, however, all of the players listed above featured in the seven-week IPL in October and November, and have been retained by their teams for the next edition of the tournament in April. There is cricketing merit to the IPL, no question, but also life-changing money that leaves the England management now feeling incapable of ordering anyone to skip it.', 'Asked to explain this to England fans, Silverwood replied: “What can you say? We’ve decided to rest and rotate, we’ve decided we need to look after the players. And I do believe we have to be proactive in looking after them, rather than wait until there’s a problem. The players can’t be with us all the time because it’s not the world we live in.”', 'That the Test team suffers this winter is also due to a desire to field a full‑strength Twenty20 side during the white-ball leg of the India tour in preparation for the World T20 in the same conditions later this year. Eoin Morgan, the white-ball captain, is perhaps a more powerful voice at the table than his Test equivalent, Joe Root, although the longer format will take precedence this summer.', 'With Archer’s return covering the loss of Wood, and Olly Stone another 90mph option here, Buttler’s departure after one Test in India is perhaps the most significant loss for Root. In Sri Lanka Buttler demonstrated his wicketkeeping can stand up to the additional pressure of spinning pitches and his batting – averaging 65 – did not suffer as a result.', 'While Bairstow also impressed, forging two century partnerships alongside Root, the Yorkshireman was less certain to keep his place in the first-choice XI; Rory Burns is back to open after paternity leave, the vice-captain Stokes returns to the middle order and Ollie Pope is now deemed a chance to be fit for the first Test.', 'Speaking to the Evening Standard about his break, Bairstow said: “If they hadn’t given me the break now, then when? It’s the way of the world at the moment and there’s no one who plays all three formats doing the whole tour.”', 'Asked to assess Bairstow’s performance in Sri Lanka, Silverwood replied: “Jonny asked me the same question and I said he’d done very well. He went into bat during some difficult periods and applied himself well on testing wickets. I was pleased with him.', '“He’ll come back into the group then the rest is down to selection. We don’t make any guarantees to anybody – I don’t think you can. I do think it’s right he has a rest. Jonny is very busy, a multi-format player and we’ve got to give him a bit of time at home to chill out.”', 'For the players flying to Chennai on Wednesday a six-day hotel-room quarantine awaits before three days of training leading into the first Test. As well as the encouraging news about Pope, who underwent surgery on a dislocated shoulder last September, Silverwood said that Moeen Ali would be in contention after recovering from Covid-19.', 'The two-spinner strategy is likely to remain in place, however, meaning the incumbents Jack Leach and Dom Bess will surely get the first opportunity. Silverwood also admitted the performances of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson – “it’s a privilege to have both of them” – could yet see the experienced duo paired at some stage, despite the main plan being to rotate them in one berth.', 'On the challenge of facing India, fresh from their famous victory in Australia, Silverwood said: “Do I think we can beat them? Yes. I always take the positive side of things. If we come out on top of this one, confidence will go through the roof for us.”']","England cricket team","Sport","2021-01-26",20.13,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e86d2a72e8f3940e3d4255c58a041f088f4e314/0_167_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=245fe6e4105ec7af918d7551eed4b5a9","Jofra Archer, Rory Burns and Ben Stokes all return for England’s tour of India, with the first Test starting next week.

Since reaching the 1998 World Cup, Scotland have won only three of 11 opening games.', '“I didn’t know that,” said Clarke. “I’m not getting six hours’ sleep a night anyway, thinking about my selection, and that’s just chopped it down to four.', '“Listen, a good start is important. Without putting too much pressure on ourselves we want to start the group well. We won’t know until the end of the campaign what a good points total will be so it’s important we don’t put ourselves under too much pressure but of course a winning start would be good, especially because we’re playing a team seeded above us. Austria are seeded to finish second in the group [behind Denmark] so if we got a good start against them that would hopefully set us up for a good campaign.”', 'Austria will have the services of 18 Bundesliga-based players after a change in German quarantine rules relating to those who have been in the UK. Clarke denied any annoyance that the visitors would be back at full strength. “I didn’t get too carried away with that because you know the quarantine rules are changing all the time,” the Scotland manager said.', '“Countries are going on and off the red lists. We knew there was a possibility it would change and we prepared only for their strongest team. That’s what will be on the pitch at Hampden. It will be their strongest team and we will have a strong team as well, so it should be a decent game.', '“They are athletic and have some star names, which is always good if you want to be a top side. You need one or two who have that little bit of magic. We expect a tough game and I’m sure they will be expecting a tough game from us as well.”', 'Progression to the European Championship this summer – a first finals tournament since 1998 – means Clarke is playing with house money in respect of public opinion as a new campaign dawns. Not that the man himself is apparently thinking that way.', '“We want to be consistently successful,” he said. “We don’t just want to qualify for one tournament, rest on our laurels then wait another 23 years. I will be in my 80s if we have to wait that long. I would much rather qualify for the next one coming up, so that is the target. The target is Qatar 2022.”', 'Austria’s visit should see an international debut at some stage for Che Adams after the Southampton striker committed to Scotland, who also play away to Israel on Sunday and then at home to the Faroe Islands next Wednesday.', '“When we got them into training I looked at the squad and at the level and standard of the sessions,” said Clarke. “I turned to John Carver [coach] and said: ‘I’ve just given myself more problems, the standard’s gone up’. It’s really good, it’s been good to see. Hopefully I can get the balance right across the three games and we can pick up the points.”', 'David Marshall is likely to continue in goal despite a lack of recent action for Derby.

Marcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka will miss the San Marino game because of injury.', 'Southgate is determined to set the right tone against San Marino and he stressed he feels a duty to entertain, particularly as the country suffers during the coronavirus lockdown. The get-together is his last chance to work with the players before he names his 23-man squad for the delayed Euro 2020 finals in the summer.', '“Entertaining is as important as winning and we do feel a responsibility for that,” Southgate said. “Over the long haul we’ve tried to come from those times when there were paper aeroplanes on the pitch and, while we’ve not always got it right, our intentions have been to try to entertain.', '“We know what those big England nights mean. We know where we were for certain qualifiers. I’ve got a Luther Blissett hat-trick in my head from when I was a kid watching England play [in the 9-0 win against Luxembourg in 1982].

We should never lose sight of that romance.', '“Not everybody at home is a supporter of a big football club.

I’m always learning. I’m still young and I’m still learning.', '“In terms of the formation, we are versatile as a team. In the modern game, you have to be ready to change if the other team are tactically different to what you have prepared for. We are ready for that definitely. I feel like I can play in any position and I just want to understand, more and more, different positions.”', 'Mount, who has scored eight goals this season, is relishing the competition from Jack Grealish and Phil Foden in attacking midfield. “There are so many good players in this team.

The visitors threatened early on the break but the Swedes gradually grew into the game as their attacking quarter of Ibrahimovic, Claesson, Alexander Isak and Dejan Kulusevski took over. They went ahead 10 minutes before the break when Ibrahimovic chested down a ball into the box and volleyed it back from a tight angle for Claesson to take a touch and bundle home.', 'With the Swedes often careless in possession, Georgia fashioned a few decent chances and the best of them fell to the substitute Levan Shengelia in the 82nd minute, but Kristoffer Nordfeldt made a superb save to keep his clean sheet intact. Ibrahimovic failed to add to his tally of 62 international goals before being replaced by Robin Quaison, but not before he was booked for apparently arguing with the referee.', '“I’m new to this playing system,” Ibrahimovic said afterwards. “That will come. We made a little too many simple mistakes. If we can reduce them, we can become more dangerous in the attacking game. It will get better.”', 'Robert Lewandowski struck a thunderous 83rd-minute equaliser as Poland fought back to earn a 3-3 draw with Hungary in a pulsating Group I qualifier at the Puskas Arena. Hungary took a sixth-minute lead when Roland Sallai latched on to Attila Fiola’s through ball, raced down the right and fired a low shot inside Wojciech Szczesny’s near post. Marco Rossi’s side doubled their advantage in the 53rd minute when Adam Szalai slotted home from inside the box. Poland had not managed a shot on target but Paulo Sousa made a triple substitution and two of those introduced, Krzysztof Piatek and Kamil Jozwiak, made an instant impact.', 'Piatek connected with a low cross from Gregorz Krychowiak to beat Peter Gulacsi with a confident finish and moments later Hungary’s defence crumbled, allowing Jozwiak to burst into the box and slot the ball into the net. Hungary regrouped, restoring their lead when Szalai crossed from the left and Willi Orban turned the ball in at the back post. But Lewandowski earned his side a point with a fierce drive into the top corner after he was found inside the box by Bartosz Bereszynski. Fiola was sent off for Hungary in stoppage time after picking up a second yellow card.', 'Germany made light work of their opening World Cup qualifier as goals from Leon Goretzka, Kai Havertz and Ilkay Gündogan secured a 3-0 home win over Iceland in Group J. Goretzka and Havertz fired Germany into a 2-0 lead inside the opening seven minutes before Gündogan sealed victory with a stunning low shot in the second half. The match went ahead after two German players, Jonas Hofmann and Marcel Halstenberg, were quarantined earlier on Thursday as Hofmann tested positive for Covid-19 and Halstenberg was identified as a category one contact. But Joachim Löw, who is stepping down after this year’s European Championship, was pleased with his team’s win.', '“It wasn’t our most incredible performance, but it was very important to make a positive start to the new year and that’s what we’ve done tonight,” he said. “We knew they’d sit deep and we knew we were going to have to force them to move in order to create space.”', 'Jonas Wind created a goal for Martin Braithwaite and scored another himself to get Denmark off to an encouraging start in Group F as they cruised to a 2-0 win away to Israel. Braithwaite squandered a one-on-one with the goalkeeper Ofir Marciano in the 10th minute but he made no mistake three minutes later, collecting a pass from Wind and lobbing Marciano to put the Danes ahead. Wind got his name on the scoresheet in the second half, reacting quickest to a poor clearance from Hatem Abd Elhamed to fire home and double the lead.']","World Cup 2022 qualifiers","Sport","2021-03-25",23.12,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81097ae1e2d5b23090414b31a10a955da39af52/0_69_5953_3574/master/5953.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4fcba393a05f49a3e72303bd1f5cc95d","Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates Viktor Claesson’s goal with his teammates after returning to the side after almost five years to become Sweden’s oldest ever player.

But the centre-back made amends when he headed down for Harry Maguire to secure England their third successive win in Group I.', '“What we’ve focused on in the last 18 months is eradicating those errors,” Southgate said.', '“Tonight we’ve lost a goal but the pleasing thing was John in particular regained his composure quickly, recovered in the game and thankfully had an important part in the winning goal. He’s built a lot of resilience over that period and I didn’t think the pass to him helped, it brought more pressure on.”', 'England wobbled after Poland’s goal but Southgate decided not to make any attacking substitutions, reasoning that he needed Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice to keep winning the ball in central midfield.', '“Our attacking players were having individual moments,” the England manager said. “We felt the importance of Declan and Kalvin in that period for giving us stability in front of the defence was really key. In the end we stuck with it. We knew if we didn’t get the result we’d be really criticised. Sometimes you have to hold your nerve.”', 'Poland provided strong opposition in England’s final game before Southgate names his squad for the European Championship finals. “We know there is improvement needed to become a top, top team,” he said.', '“But today was a good test for us. A good test in terms of our opponent, but also in terms of our resilience.', '“In the first half we found the spaces down the sides of their block really well, but some of our passing was poor.

Timo Werner missed a golden opportunity 10 minutes from time, while at the other end Emre Can was perhaps lucky not to concede a penalty for handball.', 'In the end it didn’t matter as Napoli midfielder Elmas found space in the box to turn in Arijan Ademi’s cutback for the winner. The result lifted North Macedonia above Germany on goal difference in Group J. Armenia are the surprise group leaders after they earned a 3-2 home win over Romania earlier on Wednesday.', '“These lads have made North Macedonia proud against the winners of four World Cup titles and three European Championships,” the North Macedonia coach, Igor Angelovski, said. “We’ve never beaten a team with so many titles. Now we have to get some rest as what we have accomplished still hasn’t sunk in.”', 'The defeat was Germany’s first at home in World Cup qualifying since the 5-1 loss to England in 2001, and came in coach Joachim Löw’s last qualifying game in charge. Löw will leave his post after this summer’s delayed European Championship, which North Macedonia have qualified for via the Nations League playoffs.', '“This is bitterly disappointing,” Löw said. “We were not fresh enough, we made mistakes. When we played quickly we were dangerous but we did not find the tools to be really threatening. Overall, it was disappointing to lose like that at home.” In the other Group J game, Iceland eased to a 4-1 victory in Liechtenstein.', 'Spain moved to the top of Group B with a 3-1 home win over Kosovo in Seville despite a howler from goalkeeper Unai Simón, who rushed out of his goal to allow Besar Halimi to pull a goal back for the visitors in the 70th minute.', 'Dani Olmo’s delicate chip put Spain ahead in the 34th minute, with Ferran Torres adding another two minutes later. Gerard Moreno restored Spain’s two-goal cushion five minutes after Simon’s error. Elsewhere, Georgia followed up last week’s narrow loss to Spain with a 1-1 draw in Greece.', 'Italy maintained their 100% start to qualifying with a hard-fought 2-0 win over Lithuania in Group C.

But there are teams on the outside who could still mount a challenge']","['The playoffs are swiftly coming into view and the favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy are clear but let’s not be too hasty in crowning Kansas City, Pittsburgh or New Orleans just yet. The postseason’s expansion to 14 teams increases the pack of outsiders and the chance of an outtsider fighting all the way to February. Here are the best of the underdogs (plus a team from the NFC East) who can cap a season defined by Covid-19 with a more uplifting conclusion.', 'The Colts sit atop the AFC South alongside Tennessee, with Sunday’s game against the Titans loaded with significance. The loser falls to 7-4 and potentially all the way down to ninth in the playoff race. Bank on Indy getting the job done through their devastating defense though. The NFC North-leading Packers and Aaron Rodgers forced Indy to the wall with a 28-14 lead at half-time last week but only three more points and defeat followed for Green Bay. The previous week the Colts trailed the Titans at half-time but roared back to victory while not conceding a single point more. The ability to stop high-powered offenses in their tracks, when it matters, is a handy trait. If the Colts are already in the postseason by Week 16, Philip Rivers and company have a free run at the Steelers, too. An enticing test and one that could be crucial in delivering a first Super Bowl since 2006.', 'Key player: DeForest Buckner is second in the NFL with 16 QB hits for an interior lineman, one behind Aaron Donald. His presence will be missed against the Titans after he landed on the Covid-19 list.', 'Odds to win the Super Bowl: 18-1', 'The only team to beat Kansas City so far this season came so very close to repeating the trick last week. It was a painful loss but the Raiders can steady the ship and stop the slide from contention by beating two weak opponents in the coming weeks, the Atlanta Falcons and the New York Jets. Derek Carr went toe-to-toe with MVP favourite Patrick Mahomes last week and was arguably the better passer on the day. The pair both threw three touchdowns and one pick. Carr’s interception in the dying moments was less damaging compared with Mahomes’ turnover on first down in the red zone before the half. Carr was brilliant against the Chiefs, so let’s not let defeat mute the impression he left on the game. He began by rattling off a perfect set of 11 passes with each of the first 10 resulting in a first down for a total of 160 yards. Las Vegas can win any playoff shootout with their quarterback in such blistering form and the temerity to remain unfazed in the presence of greatness.', 'Key player: Nelson Agholor is beginning to shine in his new surroundings and leads the Raiders with six touchdown catches. Agholor also has some experience when it comes to an underdog Super Bowl success: he was a pivotal piece in Philadelphia’s 2017 triumph.', 'Super Bowl odds: 40-1', 'At 6-4, the Dolphins have already eclipsed last year’s 5-11 record. Even better, they are 3-1 since Tua Tagovailoa took over at quarterback, with impressive wins over the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers. Miami’s road to the Super Bowl lies with the defense, however, and the reinforcements Brian Flores brought to Florida in the offseason. Shutdown corner Byron Jones rolling up alongside Xavien Howard beefed up an already intimidating secondary while the front seven was upgraded with Emmanuel Ogbah, Shaq Lawson and Kyle van Noy’s arrivals. Miami rolled the dice and have reaped the reward, transforming the unit ranked dead last by Football Outsiders in 2019 to 15th this campaign. The Dolphins now concede 20 points per game, the fourth-best total in the league, compared to 31 last season, which placed them rock bottom. Where Flores has flourished has been using deception to throw offenses into turmoil. He has regularly sent eight men across the line then immediately dropped two back before sacking the quarterback as the true blitzer is left unblocked. It worked wonders in driving a system passer like Jared Goff crazy when the Dolphins upset the Rams earlier this month. Forcing opponents’ passes to fly everywhere but the arms of receivers could earn a first postseason victory for Miami since 2000.', 'Key player: Xavien Howard leads the league with six interceptions. A true shutdown corner. ', 'Super Bowl odds: 40-1', 'The Cardinals should make the postseason despite sitting third in the NFC West at 6-4. Their final six games feature winnable matchups with the Patriots, Giants, Eagles and 49ers, which allows for a degree of confidence in at least securing a wild card. The Cards have watched each of their division rivals make the Super Bowl in the last decade but now, with the conference looking comparatively open, Kyler Murray can finally lead them back to the promised land. Arizona lead the league in yards per game (414), while Murray’s 29 total touchdowns firmly put him in the running for MVP. Then there is DeAndre Hopkins. The game-winning Hail Mary catch against Buffalo was the latest instalment in his ‘how to punish defenders’ series. The stars may just be aligning for Kliff Kingsbury and the Cardinals to meet the Steelers in the Super Bowl and take glorious revenge on Ben Roethlisberger for their heartbreaking defeat in 2009 at the same Raymond James Stadium that will host this season’s showpiece.', 'Key player: Budda Baker is the cutting edge on defense. He earned the NFC defensive player award for October – and the only game Arizona lost that month was the one he missed.', 'Super Bowl odds: 28-1', 'The Cowboys are true outsiders … sort of. Someone has to win the NFC East, almost definitely with a losing record. Dallas are going to do it, even after their loss to Washington on Thursday. You can feel it.

From the unchanged pack who shut down Ireland so successfully to the return of the fit-again George Ford and a beefed-up bench containing six forwards and two backs, there are amber warning signs for Wales everywhere.', 'According to Jones, furthermore, England’s opponents should steady themselves for an even tougher time from 2022 onwards. Clearly tiring of questions about his team’s lack of recent attacking subtlety, Jones said it is all a deliberate ploy to prevent opposition analysts from uncovering too many secrets prematurely. “You never want your plan to be in place too far ahead of the World Cup because you are giving the opposition too much chance,” he said.', '“The more you become successful, the more you get analysed. You do a good play or you play a certain shape and it’s on every website, every coach is looking at it, tearing it apart. So, to me, attack’s always the last thing you develop before a World Cup campaign.”', 'There is enough evidence of certain nations peaking between World Cups to back up Jones’s argument but two and half years of shadow boxing is a long old time.', '“We are dealing with human beings,” he said and not everything in rugby can be scientifically calibrated. “All plans are good until you get punched in the mouth,” he added, briefly switching to boxing mode with a nod to Mike Tyson’s upcoming fight. “But we want to be one of those teams that people sit around in the pub and speak about.', 'E Daly (Saracens); J Joseph (Bath Rugby), H Slade (Exeter Chiefs), O Farrell (Saracens, capt), J May (Gloucester Rugby); G Ford (Leicester), B Youngs (Leicester Tigers); M Vunipola (Saracens), J George (Saracens), K Sinckler (Bristol Bears), M Itoje (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), T Curry (Sale Sharks), S Underhill (Bath Rugby), B Vunipola (Saracens).Replacements: L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), E Genge (Leicester Tigers), W Stuart (Bath Rugby), J Hill (Exeter Chiefs), B Earl (Bristol Bears), J Willis (Wasps), D Robson (Wasps), A Watson (Bath Rugby).', '“We want the England team of the 2020s to be one of the great teams that people wanted to watch … a side that played with such passion, pride and intensity it makes you jump out of your chair. Of course we can’t control when that’s going to happen but we are working towards that as hard as we can.”', 'Jones freely admits there are still areas to improve – “We are not a team that is humming along like a big V8 revving down the highway” – but few would dispute his sense that England are “moving in the right direction” with clear scope for further improvement.', '“It will be dependent on form, fitness and desire, all of which we never know,” he said. “It is like preparing a horse for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. You try to plan for it to be right on the big day but if there are 24 horses it is normal to be a loser. Twenty-three lose and only one wins. That shows you the task we’ve got: trying to get 15 players at the right level and then build the squad up to 31 or 32 for the World Cup.”', 'On Saturday, with Ford back at No 10 and Owen Farrell and Henry Slade reunited in the centre for the first time since the 2018 South Africa tour, the backline may appear relatively underpowered but Jones anticipates positive momentum. “The three guys who are playing, none will be playing in dinner suits. They have got to run, they have to kick, they have to tackle.”', 'England’s pack, with the recalled Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Willis itching to make an impact off the bench, will also be urged to go hard or go home. “We’re expecting a really tough, brutal sort of game,” Jones said. “Wales are in a situation they probably relish … nothing would make their season sweeter than having a win over England. There will be a lot of desire and intent. We will have to play at a higher intensity than we did against Ireland to deal with these blokes.”']","England rugby union team","Sport","2020-11-26",22,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8364c66bca0529c6db230b3c9e355b01c88fa79/0_81_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=95d6bb89f2612902debaa72b97840acc","England’s George Ford and Jonny May (left) during a training session this week.

The 21-year-old will drive in the first practice session for Alfa Romeo and Britain’s Callum Ilott will also make his F1 debut during practice for Haas. Both drivers are members of the Ferrari academy.', 'The test at the Nürburgring carries significance. Alfa Romeo are to all intents and purposes Ferrari’s junior squad and Haas are a customer team very closely attached to the Scuderia.', 'Neither team has concluded a new contract with any of their drivers for next year. With seven races remaining, they will now be negotiating their seats for next year. At least one of the Ferrari junior drivers can be expected to take one of the four seats available.', 'At Alfa Romeo Antonio Giovinazzi, also a former Ferrari academy driver, is in his second season in F1 but was overlooked for promotion to Ferrari for 2021, with the team instead opting to sign McLaren’s Carlos Sainz. Alfa’s other driver, Kimi Räikkönen, has yet to decide his future but the former world champion is 40 and in his 18th season in F1.', 'The Haas team principal, Guenther Steiner, indicated at the Russian Grand Prix that they were considering their options. “If you think in the long term then maybe we should do a year with young drivers and prepare them for 2022 because that is also an investment,” he said.', 'Schumacher’s presence at the Nürburgring carries great weight. His father, who is in recovery from the skiing accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury in 2013, is revered in Germany and the family name attracts interest like no other.

  ["Lewis Hamilton takes Portuguese F1 GP pole to put Schumacher record in sight","['Mercedes driver locks out front row with Valtteri Bottas', 'Hamilton in best possible place to record a record 92nd win']","['Lewis Hamilton’s touch behind the wheel has been amply demonstrated this season. Yet for his lap to take pole on the thrilling challenge of the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, his judgment – the experience and intuitive feel garnered over 14 seasons in Formula One – could not have been given greater rein. The drive was an object lesson in flawless execution but that he could pull it off depended on the crucial decisions the world champion made in the tense seconds before he pulled out of his garage on the final make-or-break runs.', 'Hamilton beat his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas into second place as Portimão hosted its first F1 meeting. As debuts go, the Algarve had a thriller, a sequence of blow and counter-blow until Hamilton, who had taken the vital decision to try to be the last man standing, was triumphant at the last.', 'Yet for some tense minutes before the session began there were concerns that F1’s competitive bow here might not take place at all. A drain cover that came loose in practice had to be made safe and it delayed the off by 30 minutes while marshals then had to assess every cover on the track before giving qualifying the green light.', 'On the first hot runs in Q3 Bottas led the Mercedes pair out and set the initial pace with a 1min 16.986sec, an advantage over Hamilton of four-hundredths of a second, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who was ultimately third, still in touch, a tenth back on the leaders.', 'Their times, however, were down on earlier runs as the wind picked up in the hills of the Algarve and with the drivers still struggling for grip on the newly resurfaced track Mercedes offered both their men options for their final runs – what rubber to run and whether to make two or three laps.', 'The latter was crucial – two laps carried less weight in fuel but three offered the possibility of the rubber working marginally better on the final run.', 'Both Hamilton and Bottas switched from the soft to the medium tyre but Bottas chose a two-lap run and Hamilton the three.', 'Hamilton had an extra lap to work his rubber, putting in two quick runs after his out lap. It proved inspired but it could not have been closer as the lead seesawed between them. Hamilton’s first flying circuit set the pace with a 1:16.934 only for Bottas to better it with a 1:16.754. But the Finn then had to peel off into the pits as Hamilton circled one more time, banking on having the very best of what grip there was at the death. It worked and he delivered as he checked out with a 1:16.652, a tenth clear of Bottas and two-tenths up on Verstappen.', 'The margins had been tiny and Hamilton had been pushed to the very limit by his teammate. Bottas had been quickest all weekend but was ultimately outfoxed by the world champion’s sensitivity to track conditions at the crucial moment. The tired, belittling commentary that ascribes Hamilton’s success to simply being in the best car surely is now consigned to the dustbin of history by this definitive display of astute racecraft.', '“It’s always a fight but this track, the smoothness of the track, the difficulty we had with the tyres, the battle that I am having with Valtteri is making it harder and harder,” he said. “The decision I took at the end was what really created the opportunity. The idea of having an extra lap, an extra chance, an extra stab at getting pole looked good to me so I chose to go to that extra lap and Valtteri chose just the one. He still did a great job, it was very, very tough. I had to dig very deep, luckily I got the last sector just about right but it was so close.”', 'Having equalled Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 grand prix wins at the last round at the Nürburgring, Hamilton’s exquisite judgment for pole – the 97th of his career, another record – puts him in the best possible position to surpass the German and stand unmatched at the top of the pile. He is also edging closer to matching Schumacher’s record of seven titles, leading Bottas by 69 points.', 'For Mercedes their dominance this season has put them within touching distance of the constructors’ championship. They could seal it here if they outscore Red Bull by 40 points. It is a slim chance but that they will close it out shortly seems inevitable. A seventh consecutive title would establish sole ownership of the record held jointly with Ferrari, who won six in a row between 1999 and 2004.', 'Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was in fourth with Racing Point’s Sergio Pérez in fifth. Alexander Albon was in sixth for Red Bull. The McLarens of Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris were in seventh and eighth. AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly was in ninth and Daniel Ricciardo in 10th for Renault.', 'Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel struggled to warm his tyres and was knocked out in 15th behind the Williams of George Russell, who was in 14th. Esteban Ocon was in 11th for Renault, with Lance Stroll in 12th for Racing Point and Daniil Kvyat in 13th for AlphaTauri.', 'Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Räikkönen and Antonio Giovinazzi were in 16th and 17th, with Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen in 18th and 19th for Haas.

He was clearly invigorated by making the first step towards driving competitively again. “It’s going to be an amazing feeling, after two years not driving an F1,” he said before the test. “I’m really looking forward. I think it’s going to be like a new beginning.”', 'The 39-year-old drove for 100km, the limit in what was designated a promotional and filming day for the team. “It felt amazing to be able to drive these cars after two years and feel the speed again,” he said afterwards. “How everything comes so fast, corner after corner, the performance under braking and all the things a Formula One car has to offer. To feel it once again felt nice.', '“The car was outperforming me at the moment because I cannot extract the maximum because getting back to F1 speed is not so easy but I was improving lap after lap. It was high pressure, hard work, the car has potential but there is room to improve.”', 'Alonso undertook his first proper F1 test 20 years ago for Benetton in 2000, the team based at Enstone that would evolve into the Renault team of today.', 'On Sunday Renault took their first podium since 2011 with Ricciardo third at the Eifel Grand Prix and have been enjoying a steady improvement all season.

Last year he finished in ninth, three places below his teammate, Carlos Sainz, who has been recruited by Ferrari.', '“In many ways it is going to be the hardest season for different reasons,” he said. “One of them being that I am the guy with the experience at McLaren and I need to take lead the team in the right direction. I have more responsibility now. There is more on me to lead the team with my knowledge of how they work.”', 'Ricciardo, a seven-time race winner after stints with Red Bull and Renault, confirmed he has signed a three-year contract with McLaren and that he was confident the team could put him in a position to at least fight for wins. But McLaren have faced the grid’s biggest challenge over the close season. They have switched to Mercedes engines and with the regulations unchanged they are the only team who have had to build an entirely new car around their new power unit. They enjoyed great success with Mercedes engines in the 90s and 2000s but while they remains the best on the grid they are unlikely to hide deficiencies in the car.', 'Given the tools however Norris is determined to succeed. “I know what I am capable of doing but it is about achieving that every single weekend and understanding how to be in that zone to do it,” he said.', 'Red Bull also confirmed they would be building their own engines – based on their current Honda power units after the Japanese manufacturer pulls out of F1 at the end of 2021. The team principal, Christian Horner, is confident it gives them the chance to challenge for the title, but also conceded that Mercedes could poach their lead driver Max Verstappen to replace Lewis Hamilton.', '“I am sure that should Lewis decide to stop then Max will naturally be the driver at the top of Mercedes’ list,” Horner said.

Last season, F1’s new generation of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc showed they were not intimidated by the 35-year-old Hamilton.

Maybe God is with him, but he is not God.”', 'At Silverstone a smiling Hamilton responded dismissively with the confidence of a driver in the form of his life. “I find it funny seeing that,” he said. “I have just always known to do my talking on the track. I tend to see that as a sign of weakness.”', 'With six titles, including five in the last six years, Hamilton is within touching distance of Michael Schumacher’s record tally of seven. He is also only seven wins behind Schumacher’s 91 and four podiums behind the German’s 155, both F1 records. During a period characterised largely by Mercedes’ dominance Hamilton has won at least nine races every year for the last six years.', 'The team principal, Toto Wolff, believes his driver is relishing the forthcoming fight. “I perceive that he feels that he is at the peak of his abilities,” he said. “But that he also needs constant improvement and development in order to stay on top. The most important factor is that he loves the challenge. He loves the challenge of trying to beat the next generation of potential superstars. The tougher the challenge, the happier he is.”', 'Last season Hamilton enjoyed a blistering start to his title defence, winning eight of the opening 12 races, a run that left the opposition reeling. When the W11 hit the track for the first time, however, he maintained there was no room for complacency.', '“I’ve had the best winter training yet,” he said. “Over the winter, I’ve really been trying to analyse where we were last year and how I can grow and improve as a driver and as a human being. I’ve really been trying to focus on how can I take it to another level as a driver, how can I extract more from myself and from the team, and trying to deliver something really great this year.', '“This is my eighth year with this team and this year’s challenge is super exciting. I have no doubt every single team member will try to raise the bar within themselves and I’ll be trying to do the same.”', 'Mercedes can expect to be competitive from the off once more. With the regulations stable, their new car is an evolution of last year’s model that proved so successful. Hamilton and Bottas won 15 of the 21 races in 2019 to complete a remarkable record of six consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championships. No team has won seven constructors’ titles in succession, a record Mercedes will pursue vigorously but without taking their recent form for granted.', '“We feel no sense of entitlement to win races or championships,” said Wolff. “We know that we need to fight extremely hard for that as we had to in every year. This has been our mindset from the beginning.”', 'Both Ferrari and Red Bull finished last season with stronger performances but know they must step up to compete with Mercedes. Since the team returned to F1 10 years ago, they have amassed a formidable record. During that time they have 93 wins and 48 one-twos.

Ford, however, has also been picking the brains of Eddie Jones’s new skills coach, Jason Ryles – who helped Melbourne Storm to the NRL title last month – during his rehabilitation, to help apply some polish.', '“I’ve had three and a half weeks of rehab now and [my achilles] is feeling as good as it has ever done, so I’m really happy to be on the right track with it,” said Ford, who had featured in 53 of Jones’s 54 matchday squads before his achilles injury struck. “I feel great. It’s the best it’s felt on the field, running around in training, not being aware of it.', '“We hadn’t played together for a while before that Italy game, so it’s about getting back our understanding, our communication and our relationships between each other which is growing every day in terms of the attack, getting back to where we know it can be and even better. That’s what we’re hoping this week.', '“Jason has had a massive impact for first receivers, ball players and playmakers but also in our general attacking on the edges, how we can execute better and play a bit straighter to preserve the space on the outside. There are just little tips that the league boys practise day in and day out but are really valuable for us.”', 'Jones names his side to face Ireland on Thursday, with Ford either set to return at fly-half or provide cover from the bench for a contest the head coach has described as “a massive step-up” on England’s two matches so far.

For each of the three previous victories, Manu Tuilagi played a significant role but while he misses out through injury, their opponents have problems of their own with Johnny Sexton ruled out. Ross Byrne has been selected for only a second Test start with the head coach, Andy Farrell, sticking with Jamison Gibson-Park at scrum-half rather than recalling Conor Murray.', 'CJ Stander, meanwhile, returns to the side, and has responded to claims from South Africa’s World Cup-winning coach, Rassie Erasmus, that Ireland are “softies”. Erasmus made the claim in a documentary when assessing Wales, South Africa’s semi-final opponents in Japan. “They are not softies, they’re not like Ireland,” he said. Stander, who was born in South Africa, countered: “It’s a bit of a challenge because if that is his view and that’s what he believes then I would like to, not really prove him wrong, but I’d like to show him what we can do.

MrTiggy', 'May is a woeful failure on all counts. She has never demonstrated capacity for cooperation or diplomacy. The only way she knows how to relate to Corbyn is to issue personal abuse and sneering insults. It seems to be her default position – no wonder nearly three years after the referendum we’ve made no progress whatsoever towards a resolution. jessthecrip', 'All this is madness.

This is not a Tory issue, its a national calamity. Grow up. Tintenfische', 'I’m incredulous at political developments this morning. May loses by the biggest margin ever – yet wants to carry on as if nothing has changed, and Andrea Leadsom hectors the opposition for not supporting May. Over a hundred Tories vote against May in their vote of confidence and in the vote last night – but will all support her in a vote brought by someone else.', 'May says she wants to reach out to others – but just not anyone who has a differing view. I don’t care which side of the argument you are on. This is contemptuous arrogance. How can it be defeated? dougmeyberry', 'I think we all know that a general election at the moment, with both main parties still aiming for a cakeist Brexit, would solve nothing. A cross party agreement requires that the Tories talk to someone other than the DUP – or that large numbers of moderates on both sides defy the whips. How likely is that? A referendum will only work if the question is definitive, and even then is fraught with difficulty – there isn’t even a deal to vote on, is there? nufubar', 'May’s deal is fully and finally dead. There’s no more negotiation with the EU. Within a week, we’ll also find out that there will be no general election and no superior Labour Brexit. Norway+ means we keep freedom of movement, which effectively means we bin Brexit. If we’re going to pay the political price for that, we may as well go the whole way and just revoke article 50 and Remain.', 'So there’s only two viable options left: either we jump off the no deal cliff and commit national suicide, which no one voted for, or we put this matter back to the people. Anyone who disagrees with a new referendum now needs to explain why they don’t want to resolve this impasse democratically, and what else they suggest.

UnevenSurface', 'Corbyn who said he wanted to give power to the Labour members seems to be doing everything in his power to block a second referendum (supported by about 80% of the membership I believe).

Around a dozen Tory MPs have signalled their intention to back the amendment.', 'Downing Street and Treasury sources suggested on Monday night that the material effect of the amendment on no-deal preparations for tax administration would be inconvenience rather than disaster.', 'The instinct in No 10 is to ride out the possible damage and push ahead with the vote on the finance bill on Tuesday, though it is undecided if Tory MPs will be whipped to oppose the amendment or if the government will concede to avoid a defeat.', 'Yet the amendment’s supporters are also understood to see it as a vehicle to demonstrate the strength of parliamentary opposition to no deal. MPs are also beginning preparations to target other bills with similar amendments that would give parliament more levers to avert a no-deal Brexit.', 'Downing Street announced on Monday that there were seven bills that have to be implemented in order to provide a smooth exit, including trade, agriculture, healthcare, financial services, fisheries and immigration, as well as legislation for the withdrawal agreement.', 'Writing for the Guardian, Cooper said there was a growing danger that “brinkmanship, political paralysis, siren voices” could lead the UK over a Brexit cliff-edge.', '“Just because most people don’t want something to happen, doesn’t mean it won’t,” she said. “So it is with a no-deal Brexit. I believe the majority of MPs, ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self-inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU.”', 'The amendment has the backing of a number of Labour and Conservative select committee chairs, including Tories Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, Labour’s Hilary Benn and Frank Field, the pro-Brexit chair of the work and pensions select committee. Former minister Nick Boles and Tory grandees Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicholas Soames have also given their support.', 'The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, must rule on whether to accept the amendment ahead of the finance bill debate on Tuesday but it is understood to have a high chance of selection if the debate goes ahead.', 'Cooper said the amendment had support from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate, including from those committed to backing May’s deal and those opposing it. “It doesn’t avoid the difficult debates and disagreements ahead over the best way forward, but it at least gives us the chance to rule out the worst outcome,” she said.', 'The amendment to the finance bill would be attached to a clause designed to give the government the power to keep tax law working in the event of a no-deal Brexit.', 'If it were passed, it would mean that clause would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit. It is this format of three options that MPs may later decide to attempt to apply to other bills going through the Commons.', 'Morgan said it was time for parliament to create a mechanism to stop no deal by default. “Many of us have been clear that parliament will not allow a no-deal situation to unfold, and with less than 12 weeks to go until 29 March it is time for parliament to show our opposition to a no-deal exit,” she said.', 'Experts and Whitehall sources are divided about the effectiveness of the amendment. One Treasury source said: “It makes things more difficult but compared to the general effect of no deal, it adds to problems but it is quite a long way down. It does not stop no deal.”', 'Nikki da Costa, the former Downing Street head of legislative affairs who has extensive experience navigating the difficult parliamentary arithmetic since 2017, said the Treasury would have to weigh up if the powers could be reinstated via another route.', '“The easiest route is to see if those powers really are essential and how quickly they may be needed,” Da Costa said, saying she believed the actual effect to be “relatively minor”.', '“If those amendments, for example to EU references in tax law, aren’t really problematic, and you can afford not to amend for some time after exit day, then you might just accept the amendment and find another legislative vehicle at a later date.”', 'Other efforts are also under way to demonstrate the extent of parliamentary opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Some of the 200 MPs who signed a letter organised by Tory ex-minister Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour’s Jack Dromey, calling for May to rule out a no-deal Brexit, are set to meet the prime minister on Tuesday.', 'Separately, Labour is expected to face renewed attempts by grassroots party members to back a second referendum this week.

You have to remember there’s a victim at the centre of this. He really shouldn’t stand again here.”', 'Cairns stepped down after being accused of lying about his knowledge of an allegation that a former adviser had sabotaged a rape trial. He has been MP in south Wales since 2010 but many locals at the Vale of Glamorgan pub doubted he would win this time – if he chooses to stand in the first place.', 'Ron Davies said Cairns had no option but to resign as Welsh secretary. As a retired police officer, he instinctively distrusts anyone who has derailed a trial as a judge decided Cairns’s ex-aide did. “The law is the law,” he said.', 'Davies said he used to vote Labour but lost respect for the party over the Iraq war and changed his vote. “But to be honest, I’ve lost trust in the lot of them,” he added. ', 'Roger Price, a retired local government officer, succinctly summed up his feelings about Cairns: “Good riddance. He should stand down – he has totally lost credibility.”', 'Patrick Sheehan, a painter and decorator, at least had some respect for Cairns’s longevity. The MP served as Welsh secretary under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. “That’s pretty good going,” he said. Sheehan said he would study the ins and outs of the case before deciding if he would vote for Cairns if he does stand again.', 'Cowbridge is a tightknit little town. A Labour-supporting bus driver said he used to ferry the ex-Welsh secretary’s son around and thought Cairns was a “nice fella”. The owner of one of the many smart shops chose not share an opinion because Cairns’s wife is a good customer.', 'The Vale of Glamorgan, which includes the seaside town of Barry as well as middle-class Cowbridge, is something of a bellwether constituency. From 1997 until Cairns won the seat nine years ago, it was held by Labour. But in 2017 his majority was a modest 2,190, with Labour second, Plaid Cymru third and the Liberal Democrats fourth. The Vale of Glamorgan, unlike Wales as a whole, narrowly backed Remain.', 'Sally Stephenson, director of the Pencil Shop on the High Street, is standing for the Lib Dems this time and sees Cairns’s resignation as an opportunity. “His situation was untenable. Even before this I was hearing a lot of Conservative voters saying they couldn’t go for this bunch of Tories. They thought that Alun has been lost to the dark side – the Boris Johnson side. But they won’t be able to support Jeremy Corbyn so maybe there’s a chance for us.”', 'The Labour candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards, called for Cairns to stand down. “It’s about being fit to fulfil his role,” she said. “His constituents have the right to expect their MP to act with integrity. People still want to know what he knew about the court case, when did he know it and why has he misled us. People feel let down and are hurting.”', 'Loveluck-Edwards spent her day campaigning away from Cowbridge in a less affluent area of the constituency. “People are relying on food banks. Elderly people I was talking to today in a block of flats are feeling they have to decide whether to heat their home or put food on the table. People are feeling the pinch.” ', 'Of course, there was some support for Cairns in Cowbridge. Bryan Young, a television engineer, who was having his hair trimmed in Barbers 72, said: “It’s all about throwing dirt around now that the election has begun.” Young has voted Labour all his life but has joined the Brexit party. “Frankly I just want whoever can get us out to win,” he said. “Nobody is perfect.

I’m sorry, but no I’m not about to break the law.”', 'But Grieve did say publication now would have been timely: “It’s certainly pertinent to an election.

Jess Garland, director of policy and research for the Electoral Reform Society, said: “The lack of transparency and action on plausible threats fosters distrust.”', 'Grieve also indicated the suppressed Russia report examined a broad range of issues relating to Kremlin activities in the UK. Concerns were submitted to the committee about donations made by Russian-born individuals to the Conservative party; while members examined the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, which ultimately led to the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess.', 'Downing Street has repeatedly said that the clearance process takes around six weeks for a document that was submitted to it on 17 October.

His party would more than double net capital spending to £100bn a year, catapulting the UK from near the bottom of the international public infrastructure league table to near the top. Under Labour, capital spending would be close to 5% of GDP – a level last seen at the time of the IMF-imposed cuts in 1976.', 'McDonnell used a speech in Liverpool on Thursday to outline the economic priorities of the party, and said a Labour government would change the fiscal rules so that borrowing for investment would be excluded from borrowing targets.', 'The shadow chancellor said his programme was “in the best tradition of British socialism” and followed in the footsteps of Hugh Dalton and Gordon Brown. He also promised to shift significant political decision-making power from London to the north.', 'Asked afterwards whether the amount pledged could spook money markets and lead to interest rate rises, McDonnell said: “Our scale of investment matches the scale of those emergencies that we now face, on climate change and socially. I’ll tell you, if we didn’t set off on that march, future generations would never forgive us.”', 'Javid condemned Labour’s plans as “fantasy economics” while unveiling his own plan, which would rip up the fiscal rules imposed by his Tory predecessors in the Treasury.', 'Speaking at an aircraft hangar outside Manchester, the chancellor loosened constraints on borrowing to the tune of £20bn a year at the same time as attacking Labour for planning to “saddle the country with debt”.', 'He drew a line under the era of George Osborne and Philip Hammond by setting a new cap on borrowing for investment at 3% of national income, while day-to-day current spending would be balanced.', 'If the Conservatives win the election, that would allow borrowing to rise from £47bn in the current financial year to around £70bn, and then keep rising as the economy expanded in the future.', 'Apart from a brief period during the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008-09, investment spending has not been at 3% of GDP since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979.', 'Repeatedly challenged over his decision to increase borrowing at the same time as criticising Labour for wanting to do the same, Javid said now was a responsible time because interest rates were negative for the government and it was a moment for “new rules for a new economic era”.', 'Ben Zaranko, a research economist at IFS, said: “Both parties’ plans would represent a sharp change in policy, and Labour’s plans are especially ambitious. The key challenge for a government seeking to deliver investment on this scale – particularly in a short timeframe – will be finding worthwhile and viable projects in which to invest.', '“Shortages in the number of suitably skilled construction workers, a dearth of ‘shovel-ready’ projects and practical issues relating to delivery will be challenges the next government will need to think carefully about how to overcome.”', 'James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The economic plans set out by Labour and the Conservative parties today represent a dramatic shift from the narrow debt-driven debate that has dominated the past decade.”', 'He added: “With the low cost of borrowing, austerity Britain is going to turn into hard-hat Britain whoever wins the next election. This shifts the focus to ensuring that investment delivers real returns, not just higher debt.', '“There remain big differences between the main parties’ economic plans, which will be fought over in the election. But the even bigger difference, following today’s speeches, is between the UK’s recent economic past and its plans for the future, as both parties have signalled a major shift towards a far bigger, investment-focused state.”', 'Public spending on investment projects was cut sharply by Osborne after his arrival at the Treasury in 2010 as part of the coalition government’s attempt to reduce the UK’s budget deficit. It has averaged around 2% of GDP since.', 'The spending announcements by Javid and McDonnell came as the UK’s top civil servant blocked the publication of a report by the Treasury’s economic forecaster that was expected to show that the public finances have deteriorated over the last eight months and that the chancellor was in breach of his old fiscal rules.', 'Business groups, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the promise of more infrastructure spending, but struck a note of caution about the scale of Labour’s plans. “Our business communities will agree with John McDonnell on three fronts: the UK needs more public investment in infrastructure, more focus on upgrades in the regions, and more decisions taken locally, rather than in Westminster,” said Adam Marshall, its director. “We may agree on the aim – but businesses will raise real questions about how Mr McDonnell plans to get there.”', 'Unison, the trade union, said Javid’s pledges of cash did not go far enough. Dave Prentis, the general secretary said: “After nine long years of spending cuts, this is nowhere near enough to repair the damage done to budgets, services and staff in hospitals, schools, police stations and town halls across the country.”', 'Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said both the Tories and Labour were “writing promises on cheques that will bounce”.']","General election 2019","News","2019-11-07",20.41,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f121db4fe4395ab85c12e6b06ad651225b30b933/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0bd39b8f3bacfb4c1afbd7d825fa2113","Excavations on the Crossrail project.

Sedgefield represents his electoral triumph over not only Old Labour but also New.', 'There could have been one or two more symbolic options for his maiden speech – by rights he should have delivered his new lines about the “people’s government” on Trimdon Green, where Tony Blair had coined the phrase “People’s princess”, in the first weeks of his own premiership, on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. As it was, the prime minister pitched up at the more security friendly Sedgefield cricket club a couple of miles up the road.', 'An invited audience of local Conservatives drove in from all across the north-east to toast to an unlikely triumph, while the local rugby team was getting changed next door.', 'Johnson wore an ironic red tie for the occasion, and came close to quoting some of Blair’s most famous lines verbatim. “We are not the masters, we are the servants, and our job is to serve the people of this country,” he said. Even when he is making gestures of One Nation humility, he can’t help himself from trolling. He pulled a pint to prove he had also laid to rest mages of that other recent Tory nemesis, Nigel Farage, and offered all the familiar half-truths about nurses and hospitals and investment. The audience believed him just as much now as they had when they had gone to the ballot box on Thursday.', 'After Johnson sped off through the terraced streets in his motorcade, still apparently hardly able to believe he was here, the four new Tory MPs of this and neighbouring constituencies were left blinking in the pre-Christmas sunshine, telling TV microphones when they last held power here – 1935 in the case of Sedgefield – and spouting all the sanctioned lines.', 'The new Tory MP for Sedgefield, Paul Howell, a retired accountant, is the unlikely latest heir to Blair. He had watched hope harden into expectation a week into the campaign. He had walked down a street in the former mining village of Cornforth, north of Trimdon, knocking on doors. He went through a dozen without finding a Labour voter; the 13th was an ex-Labour councillor who also pledged him a vote. “There were so many following winds here: but the Brexit factor and the Corbyn factor were the big ones, while Boris was seen as someone who can deliver. Personally, I think people only ever lend you their votes. It’s up to you to make them trust you again to give it again.”', 'The talk in the air is of a new Thatcherism, but “without the tribal connotations”. Oliver Peeke, who works for the council, admits his grandparents would be spinning in their grave to see him wearing a Tory rosette. “A lot of our family were Labour, but I’m desperate that this time it will stick. I don’t want to go back to the dark old days when people would just scream Thatcher at you when you walk up the drive with a Tory leaflet. There has to be more to politics than that.”', 'Defeated Labour candidate Phil Wilson said “if Johnson was going to park his tanks on any lawn this morning it’s going to be here. He wants to say to the world that New Labour is history”.', 'Wilson puts his defeat squarely at the door of Jeremy Corbyn leadership.

Both sides were still coming to terms with what that meant for the country.', 'Moments later, and back to his bumptious worst, or best, Johnson took to the stage in front of a sign that read, audaciously: “The People’s Government.”', '“Well,” he said. “We did it! We pulled it off, didn’t we? With this mandate and this majority we will at last be able to do what?”', 'His obliging crowd duly roared: “Get Brexit done!” That three-word mantra was now, he said, “the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people”, and the UK would leave Europe before 31 January, “no ifs, no buts, no maybes”.', 'The prime minister did make an attempt at conciliation, however, repeatedly referring to “this one-nation government” and telling his Conservative colleagues that “we must change ... we must recognise the reality that we now speak as a one-nation Conservative party, literally for everyone from Woking to Workington”.', 'To those on the left, however, Johnson’s victory meant devastation, as #notmygovernment and #notmyprimeminister trended on Twitter throughout the day. The night was particularly brutal for the Liberal Democrats, whose leader, Jo Swinson, lost her own seat to a buoyant SNP, which took 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats.', 'Corbyn had conceded, in his acceptance speech in his home seat of Islington North shortly after 3am, that it was “obviously a very disappointing night for the Labour party” and pledged that he would stand down as Labour leader after “a process ... of reflection” for the party.', 'On the morning airwaves and on social media, however, the battle for the future direction of the party had already begun, with Corbyn loyalists insisting that a popular manifesto had been undone by Brexit, while weary candidates, both those who had been successful and those now out of a job, spoke again and again of an antipathy to the party’s leader on the doorstep that had proved fatal for Labour’s election hopes.', 'The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, toured the TV studios, insisting: “People on the doorstep weren’t complaining about our policies, and we wouldn’t have had the policies ... if it weren’t for Jeremy’s leadership.”', 'But Phil Wilson, who lost Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield to the Tories, said attempts by the leadership to put the result down to Brexit was “mendacious nonsense”. “Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional. The party’s leadership went down like a lead balloon on the doorstep,” he said.', 'There was support for both positions on Friday morning in Conisbrough, a hilly Doncaster town within the Don valley, one of the high-profile northern constituencies to fall to the Tories.', '“I don’t see it as a vote for the Conservatives, I see it as a vote for Brexit,” said one retired woman shopping on the high street.', '“It’s the first time I’ve done it. My dad was a miner, and his dad was a miner, and I’ve always voted Labour. I think if there had been another leader, I would have voted for them again.” Asked what it was in particular that she disliked about Corbyn, she replied: “There’s something about his mannerisms.”', 'John Glarvey, owner of Bella’s Butties sandwich shop in Conisbrough’s town centre, said he was glad “the community has finally realised the miner’s strike has finished”.', '“When you ask a lot of people around here why they vote Labour, it’s always been because of that or because their granddad did. It’s good to see change ... I’d like the NHS to get sorted, but I don’t believe Labour would’ve actually put the money they were offering in.”', 'But at pet store IGO pets, Alice Dann, a 19-year-old covering shifts during a Christmas break from her studies at the University of Hull, said her heart had sunk when she awoke to the result. “My family aren’t really Labour voters but I’ve always wanted to vote for them since I was in school. I liked their policies on tuition fees and helping younger people out,” she said.', 'There were similar reactions in Wrexham, north Wales – another formerly solid Labour seat that elected a Conservative for the first time in its history. Mike Evans, whose family has run the ME Butchers business since 1911, described Johnson’s victory as “fantastic news”.', 'He has voted for Labour in the past but believes the Tories will bring about the change he thinks is needed in north Wales. “I didn’t believe in Corbyn’s policies – his changes to public services went too far. We’d have gone backwards.”', 'Asked if he liked Johnson, Evans sighed. “I think he’s the best of a bad bunch but it’s brilliant that the town has turned blue. It’s been Labour for too long. We need a change. Things can’t get worse.”', 'In Peterborough, where the Tory gain from Labour meant the constituency had its fourth MP in three years, Brexit-supporting builder Martin Allpress said he had voted Labour all his life, but had abstained this time citing Corbyn’s “weakness”, antisemitism and his suspicion that Corbyn would not have delivered Brexit.', '“When the English people voted leave, wham!” he said. “I know it can’t happen overnight, but it’s like our opinion didn’t matter.”', '“I feel so sad about [Labour’s defeat],” said Zoe Bunter, a charity fundraiser and church volunteer. “I feel sad for the people who are vulnerable and those on the lowest rungs of society. It feels like they have been ignored.”', 'England and Wales aside, voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland – where the DUP had a dreadful night – were also coming to terms with their new political realities on Friday.', '“The SNP is on a roll,” said Larry MacDougall, a retired museums worker who has lived with his wife Moira in Swinson’s seat of East Dunbartonshire for 52 years. “People are fed up with being dictated to from down south.”', 'His wife had voted for Swinson, who was unexpectedly squeezed out by the SNP’s Amy Callaghan, but MacDougall said the SNP gains across Scotland indicated that voters there were ready for a second referendum. “I’m not a nationalist. I just want my own government, then I can make up my own mind.”', 'An emboldened Nicola Sturgeon later addressed Johnson directly at an SNP press conference to insist that a second referendum was now a “democratic right” for Scots.', '“Let me be clear. This is not simply a demand that I or the SNP are making. It is the right of the people of Scotland – and you as the leader of a defeated party in Scotland have no right to stand in the way.”', 'In Northern Ireland, more nationalist MPs than unionists were elected for the first time in its history. In a brutal comedown from its king-making role during the last, brief, parliament, the DUP suffered a humiliating night, losing two MPs, including Nigel Dodds, the party’s leader in parliament.', '“Heartbroken,” said Charlotte Dickey, 77, a retired charity worker who had voted for Dodds. “I voted for Nigel to keep us under the crown of England,” said her husband, James, 79.', 'With Sinn Fein’s share of the vote having also tumbled, there was pressure on Friday for the two largest parties to restore power-sharing to the defunct Stormont assembly.', 'The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, who won one of two seats for his party in Foyle, said the parties had to get back around the negotiating table. “Everyone knows what has to happen. We must take responsibility. No longer is it good to stand on the sidelines. No longer can we look in the window. Let’s get on with it.”', 'Shortly after 3pm, in front of the tall Downing Street Christmas tree, Johnson emerged in front of the cameras to make his first formal statement as a nationally elected prime minister and set out the priorities for what he called “our new one-nation government, a people’s government”.', 'It was a speech sprinkled with conciliation, careful to offer gratitude to Labour voters who had lent the Conservatives their vote, and to stress respect for “your feelings of warmth and gratitude” towards Europe. Whether they believe him or not, after a campaign littered with lies and disinformation, will be open to question.', 'His government’s first priority would be the NHS, he said, and it would “unite and level up” the country, “bringing together the whole of this incredible United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland”.', 'Britain now has five years to discover the truth or otherwise of those promises.', 'Reporting team: Steven Morris, Robert Booth, Amy Walker, Libby Brooks, Rory Carroll']","General election 2019","News","2019-12-13",18.04,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1c847bf840c684885d1cdbba33696c343fa22c/0_422_6330_3798/master/6330.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=575cb05b6f0ba51f69a5ec61ec117bec","Boris Johnson makes a statement in Downing Street, saying his new government would ‘unite and level up’ the country.

Plaid Cymru held on to its four seats.', 'Among the winners for the Tories was the former Welsh secretary Alun Cairns, who quit the cabinet at the start of the campaign after a row about what he had known about a former aide’s involvement in the collapse of a rape trial. Despite the scandal, he held on to his seat in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales.', 'One of the most spectacular Tory victories was Wrexham in north Wales, which had been held by Labour since 1935 but where Sarah Atherton, a former soldier, nurse and owner of a microbrewery, took the seat with a majority of more than 2,000. Atherton and two others became the first female Tories to be elected as MPs in Wales.', 'People who had backed Labour all their life deserted the party.

Other suggestions include turning 20% of Britain into national parks and helping farmers devote 15% of their land to nature.', 'The report advocates for more green spaces in cities through the rewilding of hospital grounds, funded by car parking charges, and the creation of pocket parks to ensure no home is more than 1km from a wild green space.', 'The report was commissioned by Caroline Lucas, the Green party candidate for Brighton Pavilion, and produced by conservationists and nature writers including Patrick Barkham, who writes for the Guardian on natural history, Mark Cocker, Jake Fiennes, Jeremy Mynott and Helen Smith.', 'Cocker, an author and naturalist, said: “We don’t believe for one moment that it’s the last word on the future of nature in Britain, but we hope it’s a start, a way of thinking hereafter and hopefully in perpetuity about life in these islands and what has to change. Other species have rights to exist in our country and we are under a moral obligation to sustain them.”', 'The report recommends moving to pesticide-free farming by 2040, with research into alternatives to be funded by a pesticide tax, and phasing out artificial fertilisers over the same period.', 'To improve urban areas, it suggests planning permission should be required to pave over front gardens, and the use of materials that do not allow water to drain through should be banned.', 'Two million trees should be planted in cities, towns and suburbs by 2030, adopted by local schools and named by children.', 'A report in October by a coalition of more than 70 wildlife organisations and government conservation agencies said numbers of the UK’s most important wildlife had fallen by 60% since 1970, with a quarter of mammals and nearly half of birds assessed to be at risk of extinction.', 'Mynott, an author and birdwatcher, said: “Outside the Green party there are a few politicians who grasp the full dimensions of the nature crisis.

This should start with a climate emergency budget to pledge at least 5% government spending per year to deliver a fairer and greener economy for all.”', 'Climate breakdown was one of the top concerns of younger voters during the election campaign, and Labour made it the centrepiece of its “green industrial revolution” pledge to voters.', 'Environmental issues did not figure highly in the Tory manifesto, and Boris Johnson refused to attend a televised debate on the climate crisis, but the party remains committed to the 2050 target set as one of the last acts of Theresa May’s administration.', 'In a Brexit-dominated election, climate concerns appear not to have been decisive in the crucial battlegrounds of the north of England and the Midlands.', 'The Green party enjoyed an unexpected surge, with about 850,000 votes across the country compared with 300,000 in 2017, though it was still left with only one MP, Caroline Lucas, who increased her majority in Brighton Pavilion.', 'In some key marginals, Green voters made a clear difference to the result.

Those without internet access were able to join via their landline, with printed resources sent in the post.', 'But as with the many other aspects of life that have moved online in recent weeks, there have been hiccups. One participant, Ellie, a 21-year-old trainee teacher living in north London, moved back to rural Devon to be with family before the lockdown, and had some technical problems while joining the virtual meetings.', '“That made discussion quite challenging,” she said. “And people have families coming in and out, and pets – sometimes it’s a little bit chaotic, but quite endearing and lovely to see where everyone is from.”', 'The assembly is made up of 110 people selected by computer to be representative of society from a pool of 1,500, who asked to be considered after invitations were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random.', 'Over the past few weeks, experts have talked to them about a wide range of topics, including energy production, transport, agriculture and consumerism, with participants voting on a series of propositions related to each with a view to determining how the UK could best achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.', 'On this final weekend the assembly will be discussing how the coronavirus pandemic affects the climate crisis, and members will be given an opportunity to raise any issues they do not feel have been addressed throughout – for instance, whether the UK deadline of 2050 for meeting net zero should be brought forward.', 'Ellie said she was aware of the urgency of the issue before joining the assembly, and her views have remained pretty consistent throughout the process. “My feelings as it’s coming to an end reflect how I felt when I initially found out I was going to be taking part,” she said. “I’m really thrilled that we got to make a contribution and I was able to be a part of it.”', 'But 52-year-old Adrian from Belfast, who works in the legal sector, said he had become much more aware of the effects of his individual actions. “I think having children makes you more aware of how you behave and the shadow that you cast across,” he said. “It’s the things that I can do, and the things I can change – in your routine, the way you live, how you travel – that’s the great takeaway for me.”', 'The assembly does not aim to provide a definitive consensus on issues, but to provide a snapshot of public opinion: if the participants are divided on an issue, the final report will reflect that. It is due to be published before the parliamentary summer recess starts in July, an exciting but also nerve-racking prospect for the participants.', '“I think I’m cautious about the impact it will have politically,” said Ellie. “I definitely hope this will have a tangible impact and it will gain some kind of recognition. I’m sure it will gain some criticism as well.”', 'It is not yet known whether the report will be debated in parliament, although it will be used by the six select committees that commissioned it – and perhaps in other organisations as well. “I think it will be really interesting to see how it’s used by other people beyond parliament once it’s published,” said Allan.', 'Assembly members said they were aware the coronavirus pandemic had completely transformed society, and perhaps shifted public focus away from the climate crisis.

So in reality it is much less than a 50% chance.”', 'The letter also argues that the climate and ecological emergency can only be addressed by tackling the underlying “social and racial injustices and oppression that have laid the foundations of our modern world”.', 'It says the EU, with its political and economic clout, has a moral obligation to lead the fight to create a fair and more sustainable world.', '“We understand and know very well that the world is complicated and that what we are asking for may not be easy.

Over four weekends they will discuss a range of issues with experts and decide on a set of recommendations for how the government can reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.', 'Assembly member Leia, 20, from Darlington, said giving up her time for the cause was an easy decision to make: “You don’t get an opportunity to influence government policy very often and climate change is really important.”', 'Another participant, Amanda, 56, a healthcare project manager from Kent, said: “I was really chuffed to be chosen. There were some things which I didn’t know about that I’ve learned today, which is really interesting, but I’ve always been quite green.”', 'Invitations to the assembly were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random, and of the over 1,500 people who responded asking to be considered, 110 were selected by a computer to be representative of society. There’s a mix of ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds and education levels, but also a range of views about the climate crisis.', 'A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to\\xa0the definition\\xa0put forward by the House of Commons library.', 'Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.', 'Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.', 'The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.', 'The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.', 'Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue.', 'Jamie Grierson,\\xa0Home affairs correspondent', 'Chris, a 32-year-old production engineer and father of two from Oxford, was unsure of the severity of the problem. “I wasn’t sure if it was a crisis. I’m not a climate denier as people will quite quickly say. Climate is real, it does change, it has changed. I appreciate man is changing it. But whether we’re at the level of crisis – I hadn’t seen enough information.”', 'He was keen to hear directly from experts, and was pleased to see opinions being distinguished from facts. “My biggest fear coming here is that a decision would be made purely based on emotion with no logical steps or thought about the implementation or the impact.”', 'The assembly heard from speakers at organisations including Natural England, the New Economics Foundation and Wellcome, and were given the chance to ask questions. Some of these were practical – “What’s more environmentally friendly, British beef or avocados?” – while some were more ethical – “How can we ensure the cost of changes don’t affect poorer people disproportionately?”', 'Participants could hold up a yellow card if a speaker was going too fast, or a red card if they needed something explained or clarified. “It’s about distilling down the enormous complexity of climate change into small pieces of information that are accessible, balanced and meaningful for people, so it is quite a tall order,” said Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, the director of the UK Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations, and one of the assembly’s expert leads.', '“Some people are probably totally comfortable with a lot of what’s been covered today, and some people will have never really heard anything of this kind before.”', 'The day culminated with a talk from Sir David Attenborough, who was keen to give his thanks to the volunteers for giving up their time.', '“If you have a parliament of a fixed length of five years, it is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry to an issue which is not going to come to a climax – and people won’t know if it is successful or not successful – for 10 years, 15 years hence,” he said.', '“Your very existence here means members of parliament are taking it seriously. The people in this country ought to be extremely grateful to you, as indeed am I.”', 'Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, observed the morning session and said she was impressed by the level of engagement from members. “The buzz in the room was brilliant. I just think it’s so important that politics is done with people, not to them … Look what happened with the gilets jaunes in Paris – people have to understand and feel as if they are part of the process.”', 'She said her biggest concern was that the assembly discussions were based on the assumption that net-zero emissions should be achieved by 2050 and not earlier, but organisers said there would be time at the end of the process for members to discuss this if they wanted to.', 'The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:', '• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.', '• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.', '• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\\xa0 ', '• Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.', '• A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.', '• 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.', '• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. ', 'The government signed legislation last year to commit the country to net-zero emissions by 2050, although the Green party campaigns for a 2030 deadline, a target also supported by Labour.', 'The assembly has drawn some criticism over the fact the recommendations will not be legally binding. Lucas said: “Although the government aren’t obliged to take the recommendations seriously, I think for a government that has said it wants to [make the UK] the greenest country in the world, it would be quite difficult for them to completely sideline these views.” The results from the assembly will be made public in April, and a House of Commons debate will follow.', 'At just 17, Max from Hertfordshire was one of the youngest members of the assembly, and he was optimistic over the impact it could have: “If this whole thing ends up making a big difference, and the government really does listen, it means we’ll be leading a new movement internationally, and we need to be the leaders of a better tomorrow.”']","Climate crisis","News","2020-01-27",10.01,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a6fb42ebeb8693ce02cf55ef6a337bd44f6c90/726_98_4274_2565/master/4274.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=f33a7ee0bfbb702c2c41ab45a0c03288"," Sir David Attenborough addresses the citizens’ assembly.

The former IRA internee has consistently denied that he is Stakeknife.', 'An IRA unit shot Bingham, a UVF commander, dead at his home in the Ballysillan district after he directed a series of sectarian attacks against the Catholic community in north Belfast during the mid-1980s.', 'At least one of the other two men who are named by Jon Boutcher, the head of Operation Kenova and former chief constable of Bedfordshire, holds an “on-the-run” letter. These were in effect “get-out-of-jail” cards given to dozens of IRA fugitives and members wanted for past Troubles crimes.', 'Sources close to Operation Kenova have made it clear that Boutcher believes this man, who comes from west Belfast, can still be charged despite holding one of the letters. These were given by Tony Blair’s government as a secret concession to Sinn Féin during negotiations leading up to reaching a political settlement in Northern Ireland.', 'Boutcher’s naming of the other former IRA member who now works for Sinn Féin is, however, potentially a much more politically controversial move. This man has links to the current Sinn Féin leadership who promoted him through the party’s ranks.', 'It is understood Boutcher has made separate recommendations to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in Belfast that a number of people involved with Stakeknife should be charged with a total of nine murders.', 'The Guardian has seen text messages sent out by the Operation Kenova team to a number of relatives of those killed in IRA attacks. One of these messages from Boutcher to a relative confirms that “the case of John Bingham features as one of the files that has formed part of this submission. I recognise that as a result of this significant update you and your family may have a number of questions of me.”', 'In early 2018 Scappaticci was questioned under caution by Kenova detectives about Bingham’s murder. He again denied that he was the army super-spy they were investigating. Since that arrest, sources close to Operation Kenova say they have uncovered evidence that Stakeknife worked with two rogue Belfast loyalists who helped him “set up” Bingham for assassination. The two loyalists are said to have provided the IRA with information as to when their UVF target would be at his home.', 'As well as the nine murders Boutcher has identified, the former chief constable has sent the names of three civilians, understood to be crown lawyers, to the PPS. In their cases, Boutcher is recommending that they be charged with malfeasance in public office, specifically perjury.', 'While a number of individual security force personnel are also recommended for prosecution by Boutcher and his team there will be no charges of corporate responsibility levelled at, for example, the Force Research Unit, the army intelligence branch that ran Stakeknife for decades inside the IRA.', 'One source close to Operation Kenova has warned that a decision on whether to act on Boutcher’s recommendations may take up to two years. They also point out that while there is “a strong evidential base” to proceed with charges, the final decision on whether to prosecute more than 20 people caught up in the Stakeknife scandal will rest with the attorney general.']","Northern Ireland","News","2019-10-05",8,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58315915b5ed08ce613588f154285c4f287825ff/0_119_2656_1594/master/2656.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=9fec1a4ad023cd7a873b07dd3ec05f82","Freddie Scappaticci – alleged to be Stakeknife – will also be charged over the killing of John Bingham, sources say.

It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR), which was incorporated into domestic law by the 1964 Diplomatic Privileges Act. The reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad.', 'As well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. (His embassy stay was not the longest: a Hungarian archbishop spent 15 years sheltering inside the US embassy in Budapest.)', 'Without a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained “as a last resort” if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion.', 'According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the immunity does not apply to dependants of consular officials based outside London. However, it is understood that some diplomatic staff and their spouses located outside the capital can get that immunity.', 'When a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a “waiver of immunity”. Individual diplomats cannot do so; the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request.', 'Diplomats are supposed to behave responsibly. The Vienna convention states: “Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state.”', 'A US embassy spokesperson has said: “Immunity is rarely waived.” A parliamentary question in 2016 revealed a table of embassies that had incurred the largest debts through ignoring the London congestion charge. US diplomats were the No 1 offenders by a long distance, with 89,308 unpaid fines totalling £10,626,970. Japan came second with 59,533 unpaid fines amounting to a denied liability of £7,072,020.', 'The barrister Ben Emmerson QC, who took a case to the European court of human rights in 2002 over the US embassy reimposing diplomatic immunity when it lost an employment tribunal case, said road traffic collisions would not be considered by many to fall within the scope of diplomatic immunity.', '“The general structure of diplomatic and state immunity,” he said, “is that those activities which touch on the core functions of an overseas mission are usually subject to absolute immunity, whereas peripheral activities – like purely commercial investments or employment contracts with domestic staff – are not.”']","Foreign policy","News","2019-10-07",11.51,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801b4a9fc900170a71e13996c3944ff696fd0ae1/0_350_7250_4351/master/7250.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=dbd2156f1309e9d62846b48432a597d4","The US embassy in London.

Among the moves were creating 10,000 more prison places and scrapping the automatic release of some violent and sex offenders at the midway point of their jail term.', 'Albutt, who was elected last year as the head of the trade union, will say: “Do not put more offenders in prison for longer, it will not reduce crime and the risk and cost to society.', '“Instead, invest that money in creating real rehabilitative environments both inside prisons and in the community that can be accessed by all. This policy will have a far better chance of reducing crime and reoffending and will also help stabilise our prisons and make them effective once again.”', 'She will add: “Stop playing politics with our prisons. Constant changing policy on prisons dictated by whoever holds the office of prime minister and justice secretary has without a doubt contributed to the myriad of complex issues we face. Policy should always be based on the evidence of what works and should be funded appropriately.”', 'Albutt praised the former justice secretary David Gauke for his “sensible approach”, since shelved under his Johnson-appointed successor, Robert Buckland.', 'Gauke was pushing for an evidence-based approach to justice and was reportedly moving towards introducing an assumption against short jail sentences of six months or less, but Buckland and Johnson have said this will not happen on their watch.', 'In the last five years there have been more than 250,000 custodial sentences of six months or less, and more than 300,000 of 12 months or less. Nearly two-thirds of those offenders go on to commit a further crime within a year of being released.', 'Albutt will say: “England and Wales already has the highest prison population in western Europe, with little impact on reducing crime in our communities. Britain seems to enjoy locking too many people up for too long in too small a space and with too little training and rehabilitation.', '“Like many other public services, the years of austerity in prisons has left a legacy which, in a nutshell, has made a significant number of our prisons universities of crime, places of despair, fear, violence and control. They do not provide the rehabilitative environment to make people better citizens and reduce the burden on society.', '“We know intuitively and research shows that prison and longer sentences do not work for most. It does keep people off our streets for the period they are incarcerated, but almost all offenders will be released at some point.”', 'Albutt will say levels of poor physical and mental health, substance addiction and learning difficulties in prisons are high among those in custody, and to rehabilitate such criminals requires a multi-disciplinary approach.', 'She will say: “A key emotion in getting offenders to engage in any rehabilitation is hope for the future. For many years now we have had the ability to release prisoners at the halfway point of the custodial element of their sentence. This motivational policy helps the individual, but also helps with stability of prisons because of the element of hope it brings.', '“Increasing the custodial element to two-thirds in prison will certainly punish the individual for longer, but it will not improve the level of risk the individual may pose and will certainly not reduce the level of crime in society. Potentially a shorter time on licence in the community could increase risk.”', 'A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “This government is investing £2.5bn in 10,000 new, modern prison places and will also spend an extra £156m next year on maintaining our existing jails. This will help us respond to any rise in prison population created by the increase in police officers on our streets, along with tougher sentencing for the most serious offenders.', '“We will of course make sure that all new prisons are sufficiently staffed and our officers will be better protected thanks to the £100m we are spending on new security measures across the estate.”']","Prisons and probation","News","2019-10-08",0.01,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1e7bb740861aa7d346e7df571cc98d2cc06ad6/20_27_4192_2515/master/4192.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=95e0622eda1e25de468a0384f7aa5f1e","England and Wales have the highest prison population in western Europe.

  ["Nations must unite to halt global economic slowdown, says new IMF head","['In her first speech, Kristalina Georgieva says looming crisis requires coordinated response']","['The new head of the International Monetary Fund has told squabbling nations to forget their differences and prepare a united response to the most serious threat to the global economy since the financial crisis a decade ago.', 'In her first speech since becoming the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said the world was in a synchronised slowdown and needed a synchronised response.', 'Speaking ahead of the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington next week, Georgieva said her organisation’s economists were expecting slower growth in nearly 90% of the global economy this year. “While the need for international cooperation is going up, the will to engage is going down.”', 'She said the use of low interest rates by central banks in an attempt to boost activity had led to a buildup of corporate debt and that there would be a risk of a $19tn (£15.5tn) default in the event of a major economic downturn.', '“The global economy is now in a synchronised slowdown,” Georgieva said. “This widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. Next week we will release our world economic outlook which will show downward revisions for 2019 and 2020.”', 'The IMF has become steadily more pessimistic about the health of the global economy since 2017, when it was confident that a sustained and synchronised recovery from the financial crisis was at last under way.', 'Georgieva said the outlook had darkened owing to a series of “fractures” – trade disputes, geopolitical tensions and Brexit among them. Tackling climate change, terrorism and money laundering all required cooperation, she said.', 'Amid reports that talks between the US and China to end their tit-for-tat protectionist battle were going badly, the IMF managing director said global trade had come to a near standstill.', '“Everyone loses in a trade war. For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700bn by 2020, or about 0.8% of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland’s entire economy.”', 'She added: “Uncertainty, driven by trade, but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions, is holding back economic potential. Even if growth picks up in 2020, the current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation: broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a ‘digital Berlin Wall’ that forces countries to choose between technology systems.”', 'Georgieva said low inflation and weak growth meant it was right for central banks to keep interest rates low, but stressed that borrowing costs were already near zero or negative in many advanced countries, leaving limited scope for further cuts.', '“Prolonged low rates also come with negative side-effects and unintended consequences. Think of pension funds and life insurance companies that are taking on more risky investments to meet their return objectives,” she said.', '“In some countries, firms are using low rates and building up debt to fund mergers and acquisitions instead of investing. Our new analysis shows that if a major downturn occurs, corporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19tn, or nearly 40% of the total debt in eight major economies. This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis. Low interest rates are also prompting investors to search for higher yields in emerging markets. This leaves many smaller economies exposed to a sudden reversal of capital flows.”', 'Georgieva said it was time for countries to use higher public spending and tax cuts as an alternative way of stimulating growth.', '“Now is the time for countries with room in their budgets to deploy, or get ready to deploy, fiscal firepower. In fact, low interest rates may give some policymakers additional money to spend,” Georgieva said, singling out Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea as nations that could increase spending on infrastructure and research and development, which would boost economic activity.', 'But, she said, “that advice will not work everywhere. Globally, public debt is near record levels. So in countries with a high debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal restraint continues to be warranted.”', 'The IMF will release its latest economic forecasts next week but Georgieva stressed a coordinated fiscal response could be needed if activity slowed more sharply than expected.']","International Monetary Fund (IMF)","News","2019-10-08",15,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391acc8cc6249bbde714c2d5a8f220e0d42618d7/0_119_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=bc97674fbe9fba4684ae3e86e4106c11","‘Everyone loses in a trade war,’ said Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director.

Ankara sees the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views them as a serious security threat.', 'Kurdish forces have spearheaded the campaign against Islamic State in the region and are regarded as some of the west’s most loyal and effective allies.', 'What was initially a Kurdish force of ground troops with air and logistical support from a US-led coalition has expanded into an administration controlling 30% of Syria east of the Euphrates River. Kurdish-run north-east Syria is the largest part of the country outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad.', 'Condemnation of Trump’s announcement and the prospective Turkish invasion was near universal in the Commons, where the minister was responding to an urgent question brought by the Tory former defence minister Tobias Ellwood.', 'Emily Thornberry, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesperson, said Trump’s decision would “open the door to a Turkish invasion of Syria and the subjugation of the Kurdish people”, who she said were “the very people who led the fight against Daesh [Islamic State]”.', 'Thornberry asked why the US president felt able to say on Monday night that “the UK is very thrilled” at his decision to withdraw US troops, pressing him on what Raab had told his counterpart in last night’s phone call.', '“No idea where that came from,” Murrison replied. “It certainly isn’t based upon the conversation that my right honourable friend [Raab] had with Secretary of State Pompeo last night”.', 'The minister later tried to downplay the effect of the US announcement, saying it involved only the withdrawal of 50 troops from the Syria-Turkey border, although Trump had repeatedly said his plan was to remove the 1,000 troops stationed in the Kurdish controlled part of Syria.', 'Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour backbencher who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on north-east Syria, called on the UK “to suspend sharing any intelligence information with Turkey so they can’t use it against one of our allies” and provide further support to the Kurdish military, the Syrian Democratic Forces.', 'Murrison did not respond to Russell-Moyle’s specific requests, but said the UK had previously supported the SDF in the fight against Isis. The minister also would not say if the UK had any plans to escalate the crisis by asking for the issue to be discussed at either the UN security council or the North Atlantic Council, which governs Nato.']","Syria","News","2019-10-08",14.43,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e25cbe1330834df29c2a3c0177a6461f353ef16/0_97_1836_1101/master/1836.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ed1c38b1b805dccb19665e2a50d82f4b","The Commons was told on Tuesday Dominic Raab had complained about the US troop withdrawal in a Monday night phone call with Mike Pompeo.

  ["Manchester to consult on bringing buses under public control","['Plans prompt warning from bus operator that local taxpayers face ‘massive bill’']","['Proposals to bring buses in Manchester under public control will be put out for consultation next week, prompting a warning from one of the biggest operators that it would mean a “massive bill” for local taxpayers.', 'Greater Manchester combined authority (GMCA) has given the go-ahead for a three-month public consultation that could result in the city region implementing a London-style franchising system for buses.', 'Manchester is the first to use new powers given to metro mayors to re-regulate buses under the 2017 Bus Services Act, in a key moment in a long campaign by the mayor, Andy Burnham, to overhaul the city’s transport services.', 'Under the proposals bus routes, timetables, fares and standards would be brought under local control, with bus companies contracted to run the services and any profits reinvested.', 'The GMCA vice-chair Brenda Warrington said: “We need better bus services. We want to give people the real choice to leave their cars at home, reduce the number of vehicles on our roads and their harmful emissions, so we have cleaner, greener neighbourhoods.”', 'But Stagecoach, the biggest of 16 bus companies operating in Greater Manchester, said the scheme would incur huge costs. It has suggested an alternative “partnership” option, whereby operators would invest in improvements including integrated ticketing and electric buses, which it says would be cheaper and quicker to deliver than through franchising.', 'A Stagecoach spokesman said: “It’s crucial that both the people who use the bus, and those who don’t, have their say on the future of bus services, because local taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill for franchising. Manchester deserves a Manchester solution, not the financial burden of a London-style system.”', 'He said London’s franchised bus network cost local taxpayers £700m a year. “The huge cost of franchising our buses could be better spent on investing in social care, schools and policing, as well as tackling crippling road congestion, which is the biggest barrier to providing better and more attractive bus services.”', 'Burnham has called for more government subsidies for the north to make services affordable. ', 'The campaign group Better Buses for Greater Manchester, which found that a further 19 routes were cut back in the city last month, welcomed the consultation. A spokeswoman said: “‘We’ve been paying through the roof for unreliable buses for too long, while bus company directors and shareholders make a killing. That’s why 76% of us support our buses to be brought into public control as London’s buses are.”', 'The consultation will run until late January 2020, before GMCA responds with a report.

  ["How putting NHS staff first is making hospitals better","['Yoga, pilates and Dragons’ Den-style contests are among a host of innovations that are turning around failing trusts']","['How do failing NHS trusts get back to delivering high-quality care? The answer, a new study suggests, can involve emulating Dragons’ Den, the boss popping in at 3am – and staff doing less rather than more.', 'A report from NHS Providers sets out in detail how 11 trusts providing acute, ambulance and mental health care in England have used a negative rating from the Care Quality Commission as the catalyst for a turnaround in their fortunes.', 'The 11 trusts’ approaches were all different. But the lessons learned from how they shook things up and ultimately regained a good CQC assessment for their efforts offer valuable insights into how quality and safety of care can be transformed despite underfunding and staff shortages.', 'The report, called Providers Deliver, points out how 68% of trusts were rated “requires improvement” or “inadequate” by the CQC in 2014 – but now 59% are rated “good” or “outstanding”. Similarly, over the last two years, the number of trusts deemed “good” has risen from 96 to 107 – and those rated “outstanding” from 14 to 24.', 'In all, 36 trusts have been put into “special measures” since ministers and NHS national bodies created that regime in 2013 in response to the Mid Staffordshire care scandal. Ten remain in it, and are receiving help – from the NHS and often an outstanding trust that becomes their “buddy” – to help them overcome their problems.', 'But the other 26 have left special measures, on the say-so of the CQC’s chief inspector of hospitals, after pushing through a combination of clinical, organisational, staffing and behavioural changes.', 'So how has this widespread but largely unheralded revolution happened? How can a trust go from “requires improvement” to “outstanding”, in some cases after not much more than a year?', 'Leadership, innovation and staff are the three themes that recur throughout the report. A trust’s workforce emerge as the key driver of sometimes painful improvement.', 'Listening to ideas for change from staff and then empowering them to implement new ways of working appears to produce results. Bob Warnock, a senior clinical professional and physiotherapist at North Tees and Hartlepool trust, sums it up. “We realised the people on the frontline are our experts.”', 'Eschewing the NHS’s traditional “the bosses know best” approach and taking genuine heed of staff members’ views led to the trust establishing a frailty team to offer older people at risk of falling more help at home – and so reduce unnecessary admissions to its hospitals. It has also set up an integrated single point of access for those needing healthcare, social care or both. It’s a telephone service that people can ring to speak to health professionals – who then arrange the most suitable form of support from nurses, social workers and therapists.', 'The two innovations together led to a reduction in avoidable admissions – and a reduction in the delays patients experienced leaving hospital to receive social care and community rehabilitation. These delays had peaked at more than 1,000 days in October 2016, but were down to 200 days in October 2018.', 'The trust went from “requires improvement” to “good”. As did Chelsea and Westminster in London, which asked staff to put their ideas about how to improve care and services to the test in a Dragons’ Den-style competition. Angela Chick, a ward manager, and Ahlam Wynne, a specialist nurse, wanted to reduce the number of patients with swallowing problems who get pneumonia. They suggested introducing mouth care kits to the stroke ward – and helped the kit’s manufacturers to design one that hung over the side of a patient’s bed. It replaced the toothbrush or sponge that had previously helped them reduce high levels of bacteria – which can lead to pneumonia – in someone’s mouth.', 'Since then the amount the trust spends on antibiotics has dropped by 79%. Crucially, cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also dropped – down from 30 to 10 year on year – as have deaths from the infection, which are down from eight to two a year.', 'Taking steps to boost staff wellbeing also emerged as a key ingredient of success. With recruitment and retention their number one problem, trusts know that making their organisation a better place to work is a must.', 'Kingston trust in south London made staff welfare a key priority under new chief executive, Jo Farrar. “Our absolute focus as a board was on staff and that we treat and support staff in the best way we can so they can deliver the best care,” he says. That includes free sessions of yoga and pilates to help staff destress – and also free physiotherapy to help treat the painful musculoskeletal injuries that are common among hospital staff.', 'That, alongside listening and acting when nurses, midwives and allied health professionals warn that staffing levels in particular wards or areas of care are inadequate, has helped reduce its nurse vacancy rate to 6% – half the NHS average of 11%. And the trust went from “requires improvement” to an “outstanding” CQC rating.', 'Other examples of innovation in improving quality of care include the London Ambulance Service’s introduction of “mental health response cars”, in which vehicles containing a mental health nurse as well as a paramedic attend when the 999 call involves someone in mental health crisis. That has cut the number of such patients then taken to A&E from 53% to 19%. In a similar vein, the South Western Ambulance Service has helped more people who are terminally ill to have their wish of dying at home by training paramedics to recognise when someone is in their final hours. They can then arrange to keep them comfortable in their usual surroundings rather than a hospital.', 'Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, says: “Trusts are held accountable when they fall short. But we should also celebrate their successes, and promote understanding of approaches and ideas that could benefit patients across the NHS.”']","NHS","News","2019-10-09",6,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0665bb82f565405f663fa48afa54b0f2942fd98f/0_83_6462_3877/master/6462.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e7808d8182d3227f358143fd2d73f94d","Staff at Kingston hospital in south London get access to physiotherapy and exercise classes to improve wellbeing.

It brings us closer to our ultimate goal: ensuring all multinational enterprises pay their fair share.”', 'Gurría said he wanted swift action on the proposals. “Failure to reach agreement by 2020 would greatly increase the risk that countries will act unilaterally, with negative consequences on an already fragile global economy. We must not allow that to happen,” he said.', 'The changes are part of the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (Beps) work, which attempts to counter the tax-planning strategies used by large companies to exploit gaps in rules.', 'The OECD estimates up to $240bn (£196bn) in revenue is lost to exchequers, which could be used to fund key government projects, welfare benefits and public services.', 'Under the plans, which the OECD launched for consultation on Wednesday, some profits and tax rights would be reallocated to countries where companies make their biggest sales.', 'The rules would dictate where tax should be paid and how much profit companies should be taxed on.', 'A spokesperson for Amazon said the plans were an important step forward and the company would “continue to actively support and contribute to the OECD’s work to achieve a consensus-based solution”.', 'Several European politicians welcomed the proposals. Markus Ferber, a German conservative MEP on the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, said: “It is high time to adapt the corporate tax rules for the digital age. The OECD standards finally move away from the antiquated idea of physical presence.”', 'However, the plans were described as weak and overly complex by anti-poverty campaigners, who said they would fail to “deliver meaningful progress against corporate tax abuse”.', 'The Tax Justice Network said the proposals would do “little or nothing” for developing countries.

The signal these assessments send to claimants is that they must go back to their doctor and ask for stronger pain relief,” said Andy King, a benefits adviser at Bristol Law Centre.', 'Public Health England recently warned of the dangers of wrongly prescribed opioid painkillers for joint and back pain. Over half a million people had been on addictive opioid drugs for longer than three years.', 'The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) has issued new guidance which makes it clear that “healthcare practitioners [disability benefits assessors] should be mindful that the level of analgesia used does not necessarily correlate with the level of pain”.', 'The law centre’s study of 39 benefit cases where claimants were in severe pain found that in almost all cases benefits were either wrongly refused or paid at too low a level. In 25 cases the severity of the patients’ condition was underestimated by assessors because they had been prescribed “mild” painkillers.', 'Several of the cases involved claimants with arthritis, fibromyalgia or degenerative spinal conditions who had reduced their dependency on powerful opiates on the advice of their GP. This was taken as proof by assessors that the claimants could walk 200 metres unaided – a key factor informing eligibility for PIP.', 'In at least one case assessors’ reliance on painkiller strength as an indicator of pain severity appeared to have more influence on the benefit decision than detailed written evidence of the severity of the illness supplied by the claimant’s NHS doctor.', 'Many of those refused benefits successfully appealed against the decision at tribunal. There, the court asked detailed questions about the pain and claimants’ daily activities before concluding that the assessors – employed by private contractors Atos and Maximus on behalf of the DWP – were wrong.', 'Bristol Law Centre said it welcomed the DWP changes – the result of over a year of pressure – but would continue to monitor the situation to ensure that the new advice was properly rolled out to assessors.', 'A DWP spokesperson said: “The type and level of medication is one of a number of factors taken into account when carrying out an assessment, which considers all aspects affecting a person’s functional ability. We constantly review our guidance and have updated it in line with expert medical opinion.”', 'Ken Butler of Disability Rights UK said the study showed that assessors were not giving proper consideration to claimants’ own evidence about the severity of their condition. “It’s clear that opioid prescription and use alone cannot be the sole judge of how someone is affected by their ill health condition or disability,” he said.']","Benefits","News","2019-10-09",13.25,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98b38fe00eca473d5929dbad80f6ca70dfbc2383/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0ce34af1f2b91026107deaa4a042c4e3","Patients’ conditions were underestimated by assessors because they had been prescribed ‘mild’ painkillers.

  ["Government accused of wrecking plans to build more social housing","['Councils voice frustration after shock interest rate rise imposed on cheap Treasury loans']","['The government has been accused of “trashing” plans to build more social housing across the UK after it imposed a shock interest rate rise on cheap Treasury loans.', 'Councils reacted with frustration to the one percentage point increase on public works loan board (PWLB) finance, which was imposed “out of the blue” this week, warning it could delay or scupper housebuilding and regeneration schemes.', 'They said rise would lead to fewer council homes being built, and would reduce local authorities’ ability to build and maintain schools, roads and waste facilities, and invest in commercial property.', '“It presents a real risk that capital schemes, including vital council house building projects, will cease to be affordable and may have to be cancelled as a result,” a spokesperson for the Local Government Association (LGA) said.', 'Sharon Taylor, the leader of Stevenage council, said: “It’s another big blow for local government finance. The need nationally is for good quality, affordable housing. My view is only councils can deliver that. Why would you want to slow that down in the middle of a housing crisis?”', 'She said the sudden rise had “trashed” Stevenage’s plans, worked up in recent months, to accelerate a scheme to build 500 homes for social rent. The town has 2,500 families on the council housing waiting list and rising homelessness.', 'The number of new homes built for social rent has fallen by almost four-fifths in a decade, according to official figures, with just 6,000 constructed in 2017-18. Despite the governments’ apparent enthusiasm for councils to take on a bigger housebuilding role, town halls fear the rate rise will hit hopes of a social housebuilding revival.', 'London First, a business lobby organisation, said: “With the base rate low, and Brexit looming, it is ridiculous that national government is making it more expensive for local authorities to invest in their communities.”', 'It is believed the rate rise was prompted by Treasury concern over a recent surge in borrowing by UK councils to invest in offices and shopping centres as a way of creating a new revenue stream to cover ever-widening gaps in their budgets caused by years of austerity cuts.', 'Spelthorne council in Surrey hit the headlines after borrowing £1bn from the PWLB to fund a huge commercial property portfolio. The aim was to cut its reliance on government funding to run local services. It reportedly banked £7.5m from its property investment last year – about a third of its annual revenue budget.', 'However, fears that councils’ multibillion-pound exposure to the commercial property market could turn sour in the event of an economic turndown led to the announcement of an inquiry by the National Audit Office earlier this year.', 'Councils borrowed nearly £8bn from the PWLB in 2018-19, a 77% year-on-year rise in new loans, prompting speculation that they wanted to build up capital reserves before an anticipated post-Brexit interest rate rise. Wednesday’s increase – from 1.81% to 2.82% – applies to new loans only.', 'The LGA estimates the rate rise will add about £70m to financing costs for all new loans to English councils, a change that will scupper housebuilding projects already on the edge of viability. The Treasury said the new PWLB rates still worked out cheaper than commercial loans.', 'A Treasury spokesperson said: “This one percentage point increase takes rates back to levels that were available in 2018.

  ["Government must help BBC fund TV licences for over-75s, say MPs","['MPs ‘deeply concerned’ about corporation’s finances amid the threat from Netflix and the exodus of younger viewers']","['MPs have warned about the increasingly dire state of the BBC’s finances as competition from Netflix pushes up the cost of making programmes, and called on the government to find a way of ensuring all over-75s continue to receive a free TV licence. ', 'The House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee said that they are deeply concerned about the BBC’s current reliance on income from the TV licence as younger viewers drift away from traditional television channels.', 'They also called on the government to work with the BBC to help ensure all older viewers continue to receive a free TV licence. Responsibility was covering the cost was shifted from the government to the broadcaster following a deal in 2015, but this year it announced that over-75s would have to pay the £154.50 cost from June next year. Exemptions will be made for individuals who are in receipt of pension tax credit.', 'However, ministers are refusing to a consider a U-turn and start covering the cost from the government again.', 'The report concluded that the chaotic and brief negotiations in 2015 that left the BBC picking up the cost were a “flawed process on all sides that gave no opportunity for consultation with licence fee payers”, criticising the director general, Tony Hall, for a lack of transparency. It suggested that there was never any intention on the BBC’s part to find the hundreds of millions of pounds a year required to maintain the benefit.', 'Damian Collins, the committee chair, said: “This is an invidious position for the BBC to put itself in. It agreed to fund a pensioner benefit that it couldn’t afford and as a result, false reassurances were given to the over-75s that their free licence fees would be maintained.”', 'The MP for Folkestone & Hythe added: “The BBC and the government must reach an agreement to allow the funding of free licence fees for the over-75s to continue after 2020.”', 'In June 2019 the BBC confirmed that it plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee from 2020. The change will affect around three million households.', 'The BBC has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people.\\xa0', 'The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government. However, in 2015 the Conservatives, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to\\xa0shoulder the cost.', 'The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.', 'The corporation argues that the £745m annual cost of maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The BBC estimates that its new proposal will cost it £250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.', 'Jim Waterson,\\xa0Media editor', 'Free TV licences for older Britons were introduced 20 years ago by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost paid by the government. However, the former chancellor George Osborne forced through a the 2015 settlement which saw the BBC take responsibility for both the cost of providing the benefit to millions of older viewers and later deciding who should receive it. This ensured that the corporation, not the government, took the blame when it eventually decided to curtail the benefit earlier this year.', 'The committee cited data about under-34s who spend on average more than twice as much time each day watching YouTube than they do BBC 1, BBC2, ITV 1, Channel 4 and Channel 5 combined, suggesting that there is a danger that income will continue to diminish in the coming years as younger viewers simply choose not to pay the licence fee.', 'The BBC is increasingly betting its future on its iPlayer streaming service, promising television producers and on-screen stars at an event this week that they could offer greater creative freedom and promotional backing than Netflix and services such as Apple TV, even if they could not compete on funding.', 'The report also warned that the BBC had ended up responsible for encouraging the take-up of pension credit. Perversely, an increase in eligible low-income pensioners claiming pension credit in order to access the free TV licence could end up costing the government more than if they simply restored a universal free TV licence for all over-75s.', 'A government spokesperson continued to put responsibility for the TV licence cuts at the door of the broadcaster: “We’re disappointed with the BBC’s decision not to continue free licences for the over-75s. We’ve been clear that we want and expect it to continue this concession.”', 'The 2017 Conservative manifesto unexpectedly pledged to ensure TV licences continued to be free for over-75s, although Tory sources have since suggested this was due to a copy-and-paste error made during the rushed general election campaign.']","BBC","News","2019-10-11",0.01,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f4ec182033f4fdb81975f9e59a607c79d1694f2/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=360348a649cd932184e7fb6b6b3004a2","The BBC is increasingly betting its future on its iPlayer streaming service, promising producers and stars greater creative freedom than Netflix.

  ["Cancelled for sadfishing: the top 10 words of 2019","['From people becoming a proper noun to woke’s use as an insult, we pick our key words of the year']","['The year 2019 might still have some surprises in store for us – Donald Trump is yet to ask the Queen if she has any dirt on Joe Biden – but we know the general shape of it: global chaos, lies and Love Island. We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, following on from last year’s “toxic” (Oxford English Dictionary), “justice” (Merriam Webster) “single use” (Collins) and “me too” (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers’ big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates.', 'A pretty ordinary word – and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of “the people” has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the “will” of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a “people’s vote”. Trump makes it a proper noun: “I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People.” Back in Britain we nervously await a “people versus parliament” election, with Boris Johnson eager to paint MPs who oppose his strategy as anti-democrats at odds with the popular mood.', 'Like one of the aged vellum documents stowed in parliament’s Victoria tower, this word was unfurled in August to widespread incomprehension. But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn’t much asking involved – Johnson’s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful. As MPs re-entered the chamber on 25 September, the only trace of the prorogation was the imprint of its lugubrious syllables in our minds.', 'Startup culture hasn’t always seemed like the most welcoming place for women, so the idea of femtech might seem like a breath of fresh air. Investment in digital technology designed to improve women’s health and wellbeing – like Bluetooth enabled pelvic-floor training devices or fertility apps – has been steadily building. In the first quarter of 2019, $241m (£190m) was ploughed into femtech companies, leading some to predict the sector’s first billion-dollar year. But the term isn’t without controversy. “When it’s about men and men’s health, it’s not mentech, right?” one analyst recently told the BBC. “Welcome to the world of 21st-century technological advancements, where brand new innovations give us the chance to … create exactly the same stupid sexist divides all over again,” wrote Quartz’s Olivia Goldhill. It’s a good question: why are products aimed at half the population deemed niche?', 'One of those rare words whose origin can be precisely pinpointed to an opinion piece – in Metro in January. “Sadfishing,” wrote Rebecca Reid, “is when someone uses their emotional problems to hook an audience on the internet”. She was attacking an Instagram post by Kris Jenner that teased followers with the promise of a confession by her daughter Kendall about some personal trauma: in fact, it was a marketing campaign for a skincare range. Sadfishing roared back into the news in September after a report commissioned by British headteachers suggested children who posted about their problems on social media were having the word thrown at them by bullies. It takes its place next to a series of terms relating to online behaviour that uses the suffix “fishing”, including blackfishing and catfishing.', 'Synthetic molecules that mimic the effects of natural opiates – chemicals derived from the opium poppy – are called opioids and they include now-familiar names such as oxycodone and fentanyl. They can be 100 times stronger than morphine and have rarely been out of the news in 2019 because of an explosion in the number of people killed by them, particularly in the US. Fatal overdoses now occur at a rate of 130 a day, making the “opioid crisis” or “opioid epidemic” America’s great contemporary public health crisis. It has also led to the fall of one of its richest families – the Sacklers, whose company Purdue Pharma produced OxyContin. Use of the search term “opioid” spiked in August, when Purdue agreed to settle lawsuits against it to the tune of $10-$12bn.', 'Previously an innocuous piece of linguistic plumbing, the pronoun – a grammatical device used to refer back to a noun you have already mentioned – is having a moment. The word itself has become a signifier of the new gender politics: it is now not unusual to see the note “pronouns: he/him” or “she/her” alongside job title and address at the end of emails or on social media profiles. In September, the singer Sam Smith told their Instagram followers “My pronouns are they/them”, adding: “After a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.” The use of “they” to refer to a singular noun, although it has a long history, has traditionally been discouraged by grammarians. The most recent edition of the famed Chicago Manual of Style, however, says: “When referring specifically to a person who does not identify with a gender-specific pronoun ... they and its forms are often preferred.”', 'Woke, meaning “well-informed”, first appeared in print in a glossary of “words you might hear in Harlem” in 1962. It finally entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017, with the definition “alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice”. So what makes it a potential word of the year 2019? Put simply, woke has gone mainstream and in doing so has been subject to a bizarre transformation. At the end of 2018, African American broadcaster Sam Sanders made a plea “to put woke to sleep”. He argued that any authenticity it once had was being lost due to overuse by white liberals, leading to its co-option by businesses keen to burnish their progressive credentials – so-called “wokewashing” – and ultimately to a backlash. A new ironic use of woke has exploded and two books published this year exemplify the boomerang effect: Woke by comedian Andrew Doyle, writing as the PC parody Titania McGrath and Anti-Woke by professional contrarian Brendan O’Neill. Woke is dead; “woke” is alive and kicking.', 'Over the past few years a new economy has sprung up, its workers “relatable” personalities who are ostensibly letting you peek into their private lives, its products whatever they pose with on Instagram. It has proved fertile ground for new words, including “influencer” for the people involved and “sponcon”, for sponsored content they post (a label seen more frequently since watchdogs cracked down on stealth ads in 2017). Subcategories of influencer have been delineated: the “unfluencer”, the “outfluencer” the “microinfluencer”. The latest is nanoinfluencer – someone who may have only a thousand or so followers. They are supposed to be like you and me (and their endorsements come cheap for the brands that target them). As the digital economy penetrates deeper, some people you know might already fall into this category: maybe next year, you will too.', 'The fear that most preoccupies modern-day public figures is that of cancellation: being dumped in the basket of deplorables after a trial by a jury of millions of strangers. Notable cancellees this year included the beauty YouTuber James Charles, whose followers turned against him for reasons too arcane for most outsiders to understand, and Justin Trudeau, whose offences in blackface are a bit easier to discern. Redemption can only be achieved through (ideally multiple rounds of) rehab, as satirised by Lolly Adefope in this year’s BBC comedy short Sorry, in which an imperious actress on the brink of superstardom is felled by a 12-year-old tweet. If you are concerned about your own status, a new website, Am I Cancelled?, uses an algorithm to determine whether you are still fit to show your face on social media.', 'Every age has predicted that the end of the world is nigh. But it increasingly feels as though inhabitants of early-21st century Earth may be on to something. From the environmental to the political and the economic, our times are defined by a worsening of conditions to the point of emergency. This year Britain and the US’s serial constitutional crises have dominated the news, but a far bigger catastrophe, the climate crisis, has begun to seem more and more real, too. In May, the Guardian changed the language it uses to describe the situation, preferring climate crisis or breakdown to the less-urgent seeming climate change. In some of its earliest-recorded uses, the word referred to a “turning point in a disease, that change which indicates recovery or death”. It remains to be seen what course our own crisis will take.', 'David Shariatmadari is the author of Don’t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language']","Language","News","2019-10-14",8,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917bbf561f0afb01fd1ab81bf278c56c8737c0e6/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=c092221eea0baf3337e6c0defa9ad961","Word up … Composite: Rex, Shutterstock, Getty,  Reuters","['David Shariatmadari']","David Shariatmadari is the Guardian's non fiction books editor and author of Don't Believe A Word: The Surprising Truth About Language","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/14/cancelled-for-sadfishing-the-top-10-words-of-2019","['Woke']",222  ],

It lifted the lid on what was seen by many as a toxic culture within Westminster in which women and men who experienced or were experiencing inappropriate treatment had stayed silent for years.', 'As well as the phone line, which has had 285 callers, the independent complaints and grievances scheme run by the Commons authorities provides a channel for people to complain about an individual, whether it is a colleague, staffer, MP or peer.', 'But on the second anniversary of #metoo, there are still concerns that there has not been a significant cultural shift in behaviour in parliament.', 'The Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “I don’t want to say nothing has changed because the former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and those working with her had a real will to set up a system that would work.', '“But the culture hasn’t changed. It’s still very much the case, and I can cite conversations about this, where if you don’t like the person that is complaining then they are [presumed to be] lying. There’s still a culture of friends and patronage in parliament. You sort out the culture by genuinely having trust in a process.”', 'Phillips said the new complaints scheme, in which the accused receives anonymity throughout the entire process, was in its infancy and its effectiveness in helping to change behaviour in the long term had yet to be seen.', 'Tara Jane O’Reilly, 25, who founded the Women in Westminster network this year to support female members of staff, said “Things have been put in place like the helpline and there’s now a behaviour code but in terms of actual cultural change, I don’t think that has happened at all.', '“There’s certainly not enough change for us to start celebrating yet. I don’t think people have necessarily stopped behaving inappropriately but they have become maybe smarter in what they do. I still hear from other female staffers of men being incredibly inappropriate in terms of what’s been said to them and also physically.”', 'Allegations that emerged in 2017 led to the resignation as defence secretary of Michael Fallon, who it was reported that he attempted to kiss a journalist on the lips in 2003. He admitted his behaviour towards women had fallen short of standards expected by the Conservative party. ', 'Theresa May’s first secretary of state Damian Green lost his job after it was found that he lied to colleagues about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer, which he maintains he did not download or view. Green also apologised to the journalist Kate Maltby for making her feel uncomfortable after she alleged he had behaved improperly towards her, though he said he did not recognise her account of events.', 'In the aftermath of those cases, dozens of anonymous accounts of people’s experiences – ranging from inappropriate comments to touching – were reported by the media, prompting Leadsom, then leader of the Commons, to take charge of the way parliament should protect its workers.', 'One of the problems highlighted was that MPs’ staff had never been covered by any form of human resources. This is is believed to have contributed to chronic under reporting of incidents as was the fact that many staffers arrive in Westminster in their early 20s straight from university and may not be familiar with normal employment structures.', 'Leadsom said she was proud of the crossparty work that had been done to improve the lives of everyone who working in or visiting parliament. She also implemented a new behaviour code and training courses for MPs, although they are not mandatory.', '“The independent complaints procedure will transform behaviour in parliament, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect. As more cases come forward and those who have been badly treated get redress for their complaints, we will start to see real behaviour change.,” she told the Guardian.', 'The highest number of investigations carried out since the scheme was set up was 14, between October and December 2018. Because of the anonymity afforded the processes, it is not known who the individuals involved were, whether they were found to have acted inappropriately or what sanctions, if any, were imposed. The figures for the next quarter are due out on Monday.', 'The leader of the of Commons, Jacob Rees Mogg, is understood to be keen to carry on with the work started by Leadsom. He met Phillips as soon as he was appointed to take her advice on which areas needed more work.', 'He said: “Everyone in parliament should feel safe in their working environment. The reforms steered through the house by my predecessor Andrea Leadsom offer complainants confidentiality and an assurance that their cases will be heard independently and expertly. We are making good progress, but there is more to be done.”', 'In July, the House of Commons voted to open the independent complaints procedure to cases that predate 2017 and to former employees.', ' This article was amended on 14 October 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that discussions were continuing on whether to open the independent complaints procedure to cases that pre-date 2017 and to former employees.

  ["Questions MPs must ask those behind the Thomas Cook collapse","['BEIS committee will want to know who was to blame for the failure and costs to taxpayers']","['An inquiry by MPs into the collapse of Thomas Cook gets under way on Tuesday, with company directors, including Peter Fankhauser, who was chief executive when it went under, the first to appear. Auditors, regulators and possibly ministers are expected to give evidence to the investigation by the cross-party business, energy and industrial strategy committee (BEIS).', 'MPs will demand to know who was to blame for a corporate failure that put 9,000 jobs at risk and left 150,000 Britons stranded overseas, forcing the government into the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation effort, likely to cost more than £100m.', 'Here are some questions that the committee, chaired by Labour MP Rachel Reeves, could – and should – ask directors.', 'Will executives hand back bonuses?This is more complicated than it looks. Yes, the company’s last three chief executives earned £35m between them in the 12 years leading up to the tour operator’s collapse. Yes, executives pocketed £20m in bonuses alone in the past five years. However in practice, not all of that money is going to be returned. For a start, the majority of the £4.6m in bonuses given to Fankhauser came in shares that he still owned when the company went under. Those are now worthless.', 'His predecessor Harriet Green gave away one third of a £5.6m bonus to charities after the deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2006 in Thomas Cook accommodation in Corfu. But expect MPs, always unsympathetic to corporate greed, to demand that executives give back any bonuses they have left over. The company’s pay committee chief Warren Tucker is likely to be cross-examined on why pay was so high in the first place.', 'How did the business rack up £1.2bn of debt?It had short-term problems such as the weather and Brexit but Thomas Cook ultimately collapsed under the weight of its mammoth debt pile. MPs will want successive chief executives to explain how it was allowed to borrow so much. Much of the debt accumulated under acquisition-happy former boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa, while Green, his successor, took over a company that borrowed even more to survive. The committee will also want to know why auditors, already under intense scrutiny in the wake of a series of high profile business failures, such as Carillion and BHS, signed off the accounts as the debt piled up.', 'Who knew what – and for how long – about the company’s problems?Details of meetings with ministers, revealed by the Guardian, show that Thomas Cook executives held increasingly frequent summits with ministers in the months leading up to its failure. In fact, the Civil Aviation Authority had earmarked the company for enhanced monitoring in November 2018, having become alarmed by successive profit warnings. The department for transport was the main point of contact with Thomas Cook but directors also met ministers from multiple government departments as its woes mounted. Strangely, the department for business was not one of them. The select committee that holds that department to account will likely want to know why. MPs might also want to know why the company was still reassuring customers that everything was going to be OK when they must have known that the business was on the brink of collapse.', 'Could Thomas Cook have been saved?A series of rescue plans involving creditors and potential new investors were mooted in the year leading up to Thomas Cook’s failure. Ultimately no rescue deal for the whole business materialised. But events since the tour operator’s failure raise doubts about the notion that the business was a total disaster area. The airline was profitable and family-run Hays Travel had to beat off competition to buy the high street shop network, expressing confidence that it was a viable business. Overseas divisions such as the Condor airline in Germany have been kept going with money from their governments.', 'Should the UK government have bailed it out?As the end neared, Thomas Cook directors wanted the government to step in with some sort of financial support but were met with a flat refusal. The transport minister, Grant Shapps, has since said that to invest taxpayers’ cash into a failing business would have been throwing good money after bad. But company sources have previously told the Guardian that a last-ditch rescue, backed by the Spanish and Turkish governments, was in place but melted away once Westminster made clear it didn’t believe Thomas Cook was salvageable. The committee has yet to summon ministers to give evidence but may yet do so, depending on what executives reveal about their discussions with the government.', 'Is the package holiday doomed?According to Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary, the package holiday is “screwed”. MPs will be wondering whether a reckoning is coming in the wider tourism industry as the internet becomes even more embedded in the way British people buy holidays. There remain more than 3,000 bricks-and-mortar travel agents, so a wider industry issue could accelerate the problems already facing the high street, risking more redundancies. That being said, figures from the Office for National Statistics and tour operator industry body Abta indicate that packages are still in demand, with people buying them in their millions.']","Thomas Cook","News","2019-10-13",16.21,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8fb44aa9644bfda63278d89d39c47c60f8da2f3/0_73_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=6bf05c9890cc31bb330ad16d7950a939","Events since the tour operator’s failure raise doubts about it being a total disaster area – its airline was profitable.

Campaigners have estimated that as many as 500 children have had their application rejected for failing to satisfy the good character requirement since it was introduced in 2006.', 'The updated guidelines respond to the 2017 review of the good character requirement by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, which called on the Home Office to review the guidance and ensure it “makes explicit the scope for caseworkers to exercise discretion”.', '“Sticking a couple of poorly drafted paragraphs mentioning children into a 50-page guidance about naturalisation of adult migrants is not what was required by the chief inspector’s recommendation that has been sat on for well over a year,” said Solange Valdez-Symonds, the director of the campaign group the Project for Registration of Children as British Citizens (PRCBC).', 'Last year, PRCBC, Amnesty International and the Runnymede Trust launched a campaign to scrap the good character requirement in child citizenship applications.

However, he added, “everyone at every level at Harmondsworth” had failed his son.', 'Fosu, 31, from Ghana, died at Harmondsworth IRC near Heathrow on 30 October 2012. After six days in segregation, he was found naked and without bedding in a cell peppered with debris. He had been suffering from psychosis. Malnutrition, dehydration and hypothermia contributed to his death.', 'Checks on his wellbeing every 15 minutes at Harmondsworth showed no evidence that he had eaten, drunk or slept over his six days there.', 'He was seen lying naked on a cold concrete floor, in unsanitary conditions, behaving “bizarrely”, not communicating with anyone and with no bedding or mattress.', 'During the inquest hearing, a member of the Independent Monitoring Board, Tony Smith, told the jury: “Mr Fosu died in plain sight. We let him down big time.”', ' As well as the IMB, other interested parties in the case before the coroner Chinyere Inyama included the Home Office, contractors Mitie and GEO, and the chief constable of Northampton police. Three doctors, Wesley Joseph, Anna Sharif and Kirpal Singh, face a review of the way they cared for Fosu by the General Medical Council.', 'The jury criticised GEO for removing Fosu’s mattress and bedding when they held him in segregation, saying it was indicative of a “casual approach” to his welfare. Doctors showed insufficient professional curiosity about his condition and the IMB failed to monitor the situation effectively, they added.', 'The jury found that control points put in place to protect vulnerable detainees were grossly ineffective.', 'Fosu entered the UK on a valid business visitor visa. He was then refused leave to remain on entry but appealed. He was booked on a flight to leave Britain on 5 November 2012.', 'On 21 October, he was arrested as he ran down the road naked in Kettering and was detained in Corby police station for three days. A check on his immigration status found he had overstayed his visa. Despite police officers’ concerns, a mental health assessment in Corby police station concluded Fosu was fit to be detained and on 24 October 2012 he was transferred to Harmondsworth IRC.', 'In detention Fosu was found ranting into a mirror. He was then restrained and put into segregation shortly after his arrival where he remained until his death six days later.', 'During the period of segregation he lost 15% of his body weight, going from 55kg (8st 9lb) to 47kg (7st 6lb). He was found to have died of cardiovascular collapse with psychosis, malnutrition and hypothermia.', 'Prince Fosu’s father, Prince Obeng, said his son was a quiet and obedient man who had never previously experienced comparable episodes of ill health. “I never knew that things like this could happen in Europe,” he said. “The Home Office has not been in touch with me but I would like them to apologise for their failure to protect Prince.”', 'He criticised the time it had taken for the inquest to be held: “When Prince came to the UK for a visit his daughter was just one year old. Now she is eight.”', 'The prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) recommended the Home Office refer three doctors to the General Medical Council.', 'Sue McAllister also recommended that the Home Office investigate the actions of Home Office staff who were responsible for monitoring Fosu’s care in the segregation unit and that disciplinary action should be considered.', 'McAllister said: “I very much regret that the lengthy delay will inevitably diminish the impact of this (PPO) report and make it more difficult to hold those involved properly to account.', '“This is a very troubling case. Mr Fosu spent six days at Harmondsworth, and apart from his first few hours, he spent his time segregated, living naked in a room dirty with faeces, urine and uneaten food, without a mattress or bedding. He did not eat for much of this time and rarely engaged with staff.', '“I am particularly troubled that Mr Fosu lived in an unfurnished room without proper justification or review, which I consider to be inhuman and degrading. I consider that IRC managers were responsible for a culture which I can only describe as uncaring.”', 'The PPO acknowledged that managing Fosu’s complex and difficult behaviour presented staff at Harmondsworth with challenges.

  ["England rugby players’ ex-soldier father stuck in Fiji because of immigration rules","['Ilaitia Cokanasiga, who was prevented from watching his son Joe play in the World Cup last year, says he feels betrayed ']","['A former British army sergeant whose two sons are English rugby internationals is stuck in Fiji, prevented by immigration rules from returning to the UK to rejoin his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment.', 'Ilaitia Cokanasiga, who over almost 14 years in the armed forces served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, told the Guardian that his immigration difficulties had stopped him from travelling to see his 22-year-old son, Joe Cokanasiga, play for England in the World Cup in Japan last year. He is devastated at being stranded 10,000 miles away from his family, unable to support his wife as she waits for an operation on a brain tumour.', '“I feel betrayed after what I did for the army and the country,” he told the Guardian. “I talk to my wife every other day, and she cries on the phone. She is very worried. I’m not there and she’s supposed to be having surgery. Everyone in the family is struggling to cope with the pressures of my wife’s poor health. I need to return to the UK to care for my wife.”', 'Joe, whose younger brother Philip has played for London Irish and England at under-18 level, said he feels “really angry” about the situation. “Between my father, my brother and I, I believe we have served the United Kingdom in more ways than any ordinary British person,” he went on. “We have been made to feel that my father has done something wrong, when in fact it is the British army that has let him down. For me, this has been a really bitter pill to swallow.”', 'Ilaitia’s account echoes the situation faced by hundreds of Commonwealth-born army veterans who face serious immigration problems, despite long periods of service in the military. Some have been detained, others have had to leave the country, and many have lost their jobs after being told they had no right to be in the UK.', 'Earlier this week the Guardian revealed that a group of soldiers recruited from Fiji were taking legal action after they were classified as illegal immigrants following their discharge from the army.', 'The Cokanasiga family had initially wanted to avoid publicity but were prompted to speak out after discovering how many other former soldiers face the same problem. Commonwealth veterans who have served more than four years are eligible for indefinite leave to remain, but the post-discharge immigration system is complex. Many assume that the process is automatic, since they have a stamp in their passport stating they are immigration exempt, and are unaware that the status ends when they leave the army.', '“I had immense pride to have served in the British armed forces, and to have both my sons representing England in rugby,” Ilaitia, 48, said. “I now reflect on my army career with underlying bitterness and my pride at my sons’ rugby careers is tainted by the fact that the British government let our family down. I have never done anything unlawful in my life, so to be told that I did not have valid status in the UK was a real blow.”', 'The legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence launched last week accuses officials of a “systemic failure” to assist Commonwealth veterans with the difficult and expensive process of regularising their status. Once they are made aware of the problem, some have struggled to resolve it because Home Office application fees have risen from £1,051 in 2015 to the current £2,389.', 'Ilaitia was shocked to discover last year that the exemption stamp no longer gave him the legal right to remain in the UK. MoD rules require that the rules be explained to all non-British veterans in the period before discharge, but he said he received no guidance when he left in 2013.', 'Joe was alerted to his father’s immigration problems last summer, when he was returning from an England squad training session abroad. An immigration officer asked him how he had been granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and on hearing that it came through his father’s service in the army, told him: “I don’t think the visa your father had when he was in the army is valid any more.”', 'He was allowed to pass through immigration, but his father sought advice from Vinita Templeton of Duncan Lewis solicitors, a specialist in this area. She confirmed that the immigration exemption stamp in his passport – which reads “the holder... is not subject to any condition or limitation on the period of permitted stay in the United Kingdom’ – was now invalid, so he had no right to be living in the UK.', 'Ilaitia missed Joe’s appearance at the World Cup, because he had been advised that UK border guards might not allow him back in. However his daughter, Misi, was getting married in Fiji in December and he decided he could not miss her wedding. If he were to now return without the correct immigration status he would be in breach of UK law.', 'During the two months that Ilaitia has been stranded in Fiji he has met many other veterans who have been discharged from the army without receiving immigration guidance; many of them lost their jobs when their exemption stamps were not accepted as proof of the right to be in the UK and returned to Fiji because they could not afford the cost of the ILR application. Others have tried to make applications to return to the UK, but have been refused.', 'Ilaitia, who worked for National Rail after the army, now hopes to be granted leave to return by the Home Office swiftly. He said of his application: “I have been deterred by thoughts of whether an application would be successful. I also have worried about the impact my situation might have on my sons’ rugby careers if the public perceive that I have been in UK illegally.”', 'He said he felt “heartbroken” to have missed watching his older son play at the World Cup, and to be missing his younger son’s London Irish matches. “I risked my life for the army. When we were in Afghanistan our base in Kandahar was mortared every day for six months,” he said. A close friend who was also recruited from Fiji was killed during that tour. Both men had signed up in 1999 when around a thousand Fijians were taken on during an unprecedented recruitment drive on the island. “It was every boy’s dream to join the British army. I felt extremely proud,” Ilaitia said. “Now I feel angry.” ', 'A government spokesperson said: “The government highly values the service of all members of HM forces, including Commonwealth nationals. The Ministry of Defence make clear to foreign and Commonwealth recruits into the forces the process by which they and their families can attain settlement in the UK, and the costs involved.”', 'Ilaitia’s lawyer, Vinita Templeton said: “Mr Cokanasiga’s situation highlights just how widespread this issue is, and how ex-servicemen can unwittingly remain unaware that their exemption stamp does not confer a valid right to remain in the UK after being discharged. This is a family that has benefited the United Kingdom hugely, but has been severely let down by the government.”']","Immigration and asylum","News","2020-03-10",19.5,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ae3679bde3a0362bcb6e2121eb4e827c21aa77/0_2_2187_1312/master/2187.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4ee6751a47e4e0160ec31da0a142038f","Ilaitia Cokanasiga at his home at Cunningham Road in Suva, Fiji.

The Home Office planned to deport him to Jamaica for overstaying. He has no criminal convictions.', 'On Monday 24 February, he slipped on a wet floor and fell to the ground. Medical notes from the detention centre, seen by the Guardian, state after Shaw slipped and fell: “no injuries or bleeding observed”. Painkillers and ice were advised, along with rest, ankle exercises and urine bottles because he was unable to walk to the toilet.', 'A later medical note on 26 February states: “I have tried to arrange for the patient to go to the hospital for the X-ray as requested by the GP. Unfortunately the contractor is not able to provide the necessary escorting staff this afternoon due to a planned charter flight.”', 'Speaking from his hospital bed at Hillingdon hospital, Shaw, 33, told the Guardian he slipped and fell on a wet floor at the detention centre after officers asked detainees to leave their cells for a room search.', '“I slipped and it got my right foot. It happened right in front of the officers. They could see I was in very bad pain but they told me my ankle wasn’t broken. I asked them to call an ambulance for me but they didn’t do it.', '“I was left in Harmondsworth in bed in my cell for four days. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t wash or change my clothes because the pain was so terrible. I had to rely on urine bottles and food other detainees brought to my cell. I couldn’t walk to go and press the bell to get assistance. Now that they’ve finally brought me to hospital I have two guards by my bedside.', '“The officers in Harmondsworth made me feel less than human. I was forced to wet myself because I could not move from the bed,” he said.', 'He said that on Thursday detention centre staff said they would take him to hospital by car but he said he could not move his leg so would not be able to get into a car.', '“At that point I thought I might die so I called the police and asked them to get me an ambulance.”', 'He said doctors at Hillingdon hospital were due to carry out surgery on his broken ankle on Monday, which they estimate will take four hours.', '“The doctors have told me it might be a year or more before I can walk properly again,” he said. “When I finally arrived at the hospital on Thursday [27 February] by ambulance the doctors asked them why I had waited so long to come to hospital. I told them it was not my decision.”', 'A Change.org petition has been launched to free Shaw from detention and ensure he gets appropriate medical treatment.', 'Maria Thomas, from Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing Shaw, expressed concern about his treatment. She said: “We are deeply concerned about the delay in transferring our client to hospital in light of reports that he sustained multiple fractures in his ankle after a fall in the detention centre and was left in excruciating agony and unable to get out of bed for nearly four days.”', 'Karen Doyle from Movement For Justice, who has been supporting Shaw said: “Like the Windrush scandal, Lionel’s case proves that the Home Office and their contractors prioritise charter flights and deportation targets over human lives.”', 'A Home Office spokesperson said: “The welfare of those in detention is of paramount importance and it is crucial that detention is carried out with dignity and respect.The provision of 24-hour, seven-days-a-week healthcare in all immigration removal centres ensures that individuals held there have ready access to medical professionals and levels of primary care in line with individuals in the community.”', 'The Home Office contractor at Harmondsworth, Mitie, has secured a new three-year contract to provide security services to the Home Office, beginning on 1 April.

  ["Refugees tell of brutality as people-smuggling across Channel booms","['Exclusive: People reportedly forced on to small boats at gunpoint as gangs move into trade']","['Refugees have told of increasingly brutal tactics used by people-smugglers transporting thousands across the Channel in small boats, as calm seas and the Covid-19 pandemic create a boom in the trade.', 'The Home Office confirmed on Thursday evening that 6 August was a record day for small boat crossings, with 235 people identified. There were 17 separate incidents, 13 involving interceptions or encounters by Border Force officials and three separate incidents involving recovery by Royal National Lifeboat Institution. One boat containing 15 people landed at Dungeness beach in Kent. The Home Office has pledged to take tougher measurers to halt these crossings. ', 'The Guardian has heard testimonies of migrants being forced into boats at gunpoint or knifepoint and threatened with having their fingernails ripped out if they do not follow the orders of smugglers, who often use inflatable dinghies to transport their human cargo.', 'Growing numbers of unaccompanied children, usually teenagers, are reported to be among those trying to travel from France to the UK by sea, with more than 2,000 people said to have entered the country by this route in June – more than four times the known total of 500 for the whole of 2018. There were reports on Thursday night that the home secretary, Priti Patel, wants to use the Royal Navy to patrol the Channel to stop migrant crossings.', 'On Thursday, Border Force patrol vessels and local lifeboats were involved in rescuing more than 100 migrants in small boats in the Channel. A week ago, a record 202 migrants made it to UK shores on one day, in 20 boats. On the same day, five children were among 18 migrants to be rescued from a boat taking on water off the coast of Escalles, near Calais. Some on board were found to be hypothermic and one had to be given oxygen.', 'MPs on the home affairs select committee have announced an inquiry into the rise in migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, the role of criminal gangs and the response of the English and French authorities. “This will include the risk to life when attempting to cross the Channel, the world’s busiest waterway, in small boats and the response of UK authorities when they reach the UK, in particular unaccompanied children,” a statement from the committee said.', 'According to experts, a combination of months of good weather, the coronavirus pandemic reducing the number of lorries stopping off in Calais, and an absence of safe and legal routes for people to reach the UK to claim asylum has led to the huge increase in the use of small boats. Campaigners say that at first these crossings were haphazard and chaotic but now organised criminal gangs have moved in, detecting a business opportunity.', 'In 2018, there were 297 boat crossings, with a sharp increase to 1,890 in 2019. Although figures for the first half of this year have not been confirmed, the total for 2020 is likely to be far higher. ', 'The going rate for a space in an overloaded dinghy from northern France to the UK is around £3,000. The main countries that people gathering in northern France are fleeing include Eritrea, Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Often those fleeing countries in the Middle East have had shorter journeys than refugees from conflicts in Africa, and have more money with which to pay smugglers. Those who buy a kayak can paddle over 20 miles across the Channel for about one-tenth of the cost.', 'In May the Guardian revealed that the Home Office was running Operation Sillath to track migrants who reach the UK in small boats. Those who arrive this way are flagged on internal systems. Patel has indicated she is keen to expedite the return of this group to France but a case is under way to challenge the plan’s lawfulness.', 'Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is bringing the legal challenge, said: “Refugees are fleeing death, war and torture. That is why they are prepared to risk life and limb, death by drowning, imprisonment and enslavement along the way. Far from dismantling the hostile environment, Priti Patel is taking it to its extreme.”', 'Charities said the government’s policy to clamp down on sea crossings was not working. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais which works with refugees in northern France and Belgium, said: “This week three 16-year-old boys from Sudan arrived. They left home aged 14 to 15, crossed the Sahara alone, went through Libya on their own and crossed the Mediterranean on their own. It’s people like them who are taking greater and greater risks to cross the UK. It’s really scaring me.”', 'The Refugee Council called on Patel to create safer routes for asylum seekers. A spokesperson said: “We strongly urge the home secretary to change her approach on this issue. Tightening border security is not the solution and only serves to push people seeking asylum to take higher risks. Creating safe and regular routes to the UK – through an expanded resettlement programme, humanitarian visas, and reforming the restrictive family reunion rules – is the way to effectively address this issue.”', 'Chris Philp, the minister for immigration compliance and the courts, said:“I share the anger and frustration of the public at the appalling number of crossings we have seen today. The crossings are totally unacceptable and unnecessary as France is a safe country. We work closely with France and I will be in Paris early next week to seek to agree stronger measures with them, including interceptions and returns.', '“This situation simply cannot go on. We have to make the route completely unviable. Then migrants will have no incentive to come to northern France or attempt the crossing in the first place. We intend to return as many migrants who have arrived as possible. There are returns flights planned in the coming days. And we will also continue to go after the heinous criminals and organised crime networks putting people’s lives at risk. Twenty-two people smugglers have been jailed this year and two more were charged last weekend.” ', 'A spokesperson for the French embassy said: “This is a major issue of concern shared by both countries, which must work together to end the illegal and dangerous activities of people smugglers. The task of ensuring the security of the coastline places a significant burden on the French security forces. They are very actively mobilised and thwart the majority of sea crossings today.”']","Immigration and asylum","News","2020-08-07",7.47,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4936a627b0879f5b583ef330dddeb82d58093dd/16_0_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e9253a0f6994cc62a8d6a09361768845","Dinghies tied up at the port of Dover after being seized by Border Force officers.

It will be abandoned from Friday, according to a letter from Home Office solicitors seen by the Guardian.', 'The decision to scrap it comes ahead of a judicial review from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which was to challenge the Home Office’s artificial intelligence system that filters UK visa applications.', 'Campaigners claim the Home Office decision to drop the algorithm ahead of the court case represents the UK’s first successful challenge to an AI decision-making system.', 'Chai Patel, JCWI’s legal policy director, said: “The Home Office’s own independent review of the Windrush scandal found it was oblivious to the racist assumptions and systems it operates.', '“This streaming tool took decades of institutionally racist practices, such as targeting particular nationalities for immigration raids, and turned them into software. The immigration system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up to monitor such bias and to root it out.”', 'In their submission to the high court, JWCI and the technology justice campaign group Foxglove said the algorithm created three channels for applicants, including a so-called “fast lane” that would lead to “speedy boarding for white people” from the most favoured countries in the system.', 'In the Home Office letter, its solicitors confirm that the home secretary, Priti Patel, “has decided that she will discontinue the use of the streaming tool to assess visa applications, pending a substitute review of its operation”.', 'Referring to the redesign of a new streaming visa system, the letter continues: “In the course of that redesign, our client intends carefully to consider and assess the points you have raised in your claim including, issues around unconscious bias and the use of nationality generally in the streaming tool.”', 'However, the Home Office solicitors add: “For clarity, the fact of the redesign does not mean that the secretary of state for the home department accepts the allegations in your claim form.”', 'Cori Crider, the founder and director of Foxglove, said: “What we need is democracy, not government by secret algorithm. Before any further systems get rolled out, let’s ask the public whether automation is appropriate at all, and make the systems transparent so biases can be spotted and dug out at the roots.”', 'A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have been reviewing how the visa application streaming tool operates and will be redesigning our processes to make them even more streamlined and secure.', '“We do not accept the allegations Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants made in their judicial review claim and whilst litigation is still ongoing it would not be appropriate for the department to comment any further.”']","Immigration and asylum","News","2020-08-04",12.47,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b9cca52a0de2d11df9b7493d86e7ec686214db5/0_547_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=674cef969db471d8884f7442e109daf6","Home Office solicitors confirmed that the home secretary, Priti Patel (pictured), ‘has decided that she will discontinue the use of the streaming tool to assess visa applications, pending a substitute review of its operation’.

But demand has not gone down.”', 'Jonny Willis, CEO of Refugee Youth Service, said they work in Calais and in Greece with young refugees, providing information about safe options. He said: “When young people get into a dinghy in Calais they know the risks. Very few of them will have made it here without having already crossed a very dangerous stretch of water previously.

There was sympathy from colleagues at the period of limbo followed without charges while an even more bitter rift opened up between party HQ and Elphicke, who was backed by his local association.', 'Even Soubry, who said she believed there was no smoke without fire when it came to the sort of accusations faced by Elphicke, said: “I felt he was treated very badly in the sense that he had all these allegations hanging over his head for some time.”', 'But that sympathy went only so far. Some speak of a colleague who was described as “bombastic” and was inclined to swim at the top of the current.', 'One other woman who had been an MP recently told the Guardian of Elphicke: “Smarmy bugger, suspect where there is smoke, there is fire. Tried it on with me a bit.”', 'She praised the role of two female Conservative MPs in dealing with the allegations, Margot James and Anne Milton, who she said would “never have dreamed” of putting party before doing the right thing. Soubry says that too often the opposite has happened. James put the young parliamentary worker in touch with Milton, then deputy chief whip, who advised the woman that she should consider speaking to the police.', 'But it was another woman, Elphicke’s wife, Natalie, who was his staunchest and most vocal defender throughout, accusing the party HQ of tipping off the media before he was informed of his suspension. In the 2019 election she won her husband’s former seat for the Conservatives. A credible candidate in her own right with a background in law and Conservative policymaking, some sceptics nevertheless suggested she had been keeping the seat “warm” for her husband.', 'Now that he is facing a prison sentence, Natalie Elphicke has now also detached herself from him, tweeting less than an hour after the verdict that it “ends her 25 year marriage to the only man I have ever loved.”', ' This article was amended on 4 October 2020.

  ["Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlaw quits","['MSP who took job in February says he is not best person to lead party in Scottish elections']","['Jackson Carlaw has resigned suddenly as the Scottish Conservative leader, claiming he is not the right person to lead his party into the forthcoming Holyrood elections.', 'Hours after a combative session at first minister’s questions, Carlaw issued a statement saying he had reached the “simple if painful conclusion” over the past few weeks that the Scottish Conservatives needed a new and better leader.', 'His unexpected departure, only five months after he was elected as Ruth Davidson’s successor, follows a spate of opinion polls giving Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party a hefty lead, putting a fresh independence referendum firmly on the agenda.', '“[I] simply believe that a new leader will be able, as we recover from the Covid-19 emergency, to make the case for the Scottish Conservatives and the union better than me,” Carlaw said. “That is all that matters.”', 'It is thought that Davidson will make an unexpected return to frontline politics by standing in for Carlaw at first minister’s questions after the Scottish parliament recess, acting as interim leader, until his successor is appointed.', 'First elected to Holyrood in 2007, Carlaw served as Davidson’s deputy for eight years before becoming interim leader after she quit suddenly last August. Her decision was made in protest at Boris Johnson’s selection as leader of the UK party, and to spend more time with her young son and partner.', 'Party sources said senior Scottish Tories had become increasingly critical of Carlaw’s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, accusing him of failing to hold Sturgeon to account and of tactical errors.', 'With the next Holyrood elections due in May, the latest Panelbase poll put the SNP on 55%, with the Scottish Tories a distant second at 20%. Three successive Panelbase polls put support for independence at 52%-54% – the highest on record.', 'In a statement released late on Thursday, Carlaw said: “In the last few weeks, I have reached a simple if painful conclusion – that I am not, in the present circumstances, the person best placed to lead that case over these next vital months in Scottish politics prior to the Holyrood elections.', '“Given the importance I attach to the job, I’ve therefore decided to stand down with immediate effect.”', 'His resignation is a serious blow for Johnson, as it will fuel opposition attacks on his leadership. In a clear sign he had cleared that decision with the prime minister, the Scottish Tory party also issued a statement from Johnson.', '“Jackson Carlaw has been a tremendous servant to the Scottish Conservative party for more than four decades,” the prime minister said.', '“As an activist, deputy chairman, deputy leader and leader, he has given his all and deserves our thanks for his efforts. It is a mark of his commitment to the cause that he chooses to stand aside at this time and I offer my best wishes to him, [his wife] Wynne and the family.”', 'One source said the looming Holyrood election campaign meant Carlaw had to quit now or stay in post until after the vote, but he had shown increasing signs of unhappiness over the summer, suggesting Carlaw had faced pressure to stand down.', 'Sturgeon tweeted her sympathies:', 'I wish Jackson Carlaw all the best. We’ve crossed swords politically on many occasions, but worked constructively on some issues too - he has, eg, been a strong voice for women suffering mesh complications. Leadership is a tough business and I’m sure his decision wasn’t easy.', 'Pundits and party insiders said the most obvious candidate to succeed Carlaw was Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray and a former regional MSP who served for a year at Holyrood before beating Angus Robertson, the then Westminster leader of the SNP, in Moray in the June 2017 snap general election. Ross held Moray in December, surviving when other Scottish Tories lost their seats to the SNP.', 'Ross, a qualified football referee, notably became the first minister to quit Johnson’s government in protest at the Dominic Cummings scandal. He left a post in the Scotland Office after the prime minister’s chief adviser admitted travelling to his parents’ home in Durham during lockdown while he and his wife had the virus. ', 'Although no one has yet declared an intention to try to succeed Carlaw, other possible candidates include Murdo Fraser, a senior Tory who lost to Davidson in the 2011 Scottish leadership contest but has favoured splitting from the UK party, or Miles Briggs, the party’s health spokesman.', 'One source said Carlaw suffered from negative comparisons with Davidson, who achieved legendary status in the Tory party after winning 13 Scottish Westminster seats in 2017 and making the Tories the second largest party at Holyrood.', '“It’s a bit like taking over Manchester United after Alex Ferguson quit,” the source said. “He’s always going to endure unflattering comparisons with Ruth. Senior members of the Tory group had lost confidence in him.

  ["Pay rise for teachers will halve school funding boost in England","['Exclusive: analysis reveals pay award will come out of promised extra cash for state schools']","['School budgets will be less than 2% better off next year after it was revealed that the government’s pay increases for teachers will absorb more than half of the extra funding promised for state schools in England.', 'Analysis by the House of Commons library for the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran calculated that the pay award announced by the government last month would come entirely from school budgets, eating into the funding boost announced for 2020-21 onwards.', 'The extra billions for school funding promised in the pre-election spending round will shrink to just £1.7bn in 2020-21 after accounting for the pay rise. Compared with 2019-20, that means the school budget increase from the Department for Education (DfE) will slow from 5.1% to just 1.9% in real terms.', 'The Commons researchers said the funding figures also do not include the additional costs that schools face as a result of Covid-19, such as intensive cleaning and remodelling or other extra spending.', 'Moran, the Lib Dem education spokesperson and a contender for the party’s leadership, said: “Our teachers have gone through the most tumultuous times in their careers because of Covid-19, and they deserve a pay rise. But the government’s failure to budget for this increase means many schools risk being left short-changed.', '“Boris Johnson claims getting children back into school is a national priority. He must now ensure schools have the resources they need to cope with the pressures caused by coronavirus and ensure no child is left behind.”', 'The researchers said the DfE’s schools budget increased from £44bn in 2019-20, to £47bn in 2020-21, including additional funding for pensions, for an overall increase of 5.1% in real terms.', 'However, last month the government said teachers’ salaries would rise by 3% overall next year, including a 5.5% bump for new teachers. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the pay rises would be funded from existing budgets, in effect cutting the net increase to £1.7bn, or just 1.9% in real terms.', '“This indicates that in both cash and real terms, the teacher pay increases will not erode all of the announced increases in school funding. However this will vary greatly between different schools depending on their individual circumstances,” the researchers stated.', 'They also noted that the figures do not include “increases in pupil numbers or other cost pressures schools may face,” such as extra cleaning to limit the spread of Covid 19, or the additional £1bn catch-up tutoring and support fund announced in June.', 'Jules White, the leader of the Worth Less? Group of headteachers lobbying for better school funding, said many had feared the promised increases in school funding would not be as significant as the original headlines suggested.', '“We are already operating on a shoestring and it would be disastrous if the promised ‘levelling up’ and improvements to school budgets turned out to be little more than a mirage,” White said.', 'Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This means an anxious summer for school leaders as they decide what they have to cut to afford pay increases for their staff – or if they even need to lose some people to pay the rest more. A summer of stress and difficult decisions is no reward after months of going above and beyond during the pandemic.”', 'A DfE spokesperson said: “We want to make teaching attractive to the most talented candidates by recognising the outstanding contribution teachers make to our society. This is why we are introducing the biggest pay rise the profession has seen since 2005, with above-inflation rises to the pay ranges for every single teacher in the country.', '“We are increasing core schools funding by £2.6bn in 2020-21, rising to a £7.1bn increase in 2022-23 compared with 2019-20. This is part of our three-year £14bn funding settlement to level up education funding and opportunity across the country.”', ' This article was amended on 3 August 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly reported that the House of Commons researchers had said funding figures did not include the “extra costs of providing free school meals during the summer holidays”.

I’m also concerned about children who have missed masses of their schooling – for some children six months of their education has been lost,” he said.', 'Criminologists warned against interpreting too much from a month or two worth of data, but went on to warn that the looming economic pressures are likely to heavily impact young people unless politicians act.', 'Prof Tim Newburn, of the London School of Economics, said: “If you put together the educational dislocation with the more than once in a generational economic downturn, you cannot be comfortable about the likely future trends for crime.

Last year, overall results fell for the fourth year running.', 'Partly reflecting the improved results, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said the number of Scottish pupils who won university and college places in Scotland had increased by 220 this year to 28,240, despite a fall in the number of 18-year-olds.', 'Schools were asked to predict exam results for Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers based on a pupil’s past performance, but the SQA amended 133,000 entries, with only 7% adjusted upwards. The vast majority were amended downwards by a full grade.', 'Iain Gray, Scottish Labour’s education spokesman and a former teacher, said its decisions were an insult to teachers and detrimental to students whose results were unfairly downgraded, hitting their chances of getting their preferred university place.', '“Worst of all, the SQA have done this on the basis of each school’s past performance, marking the school, not the pupil, and baking in the attainment gap. They were told that this would be grossly unfair and it is. The SQA have also treated teachers’ professional judgment with contempt,” Gray said.', '“The SQA will now be deluged with appeals.

They’re turning the system on its head at a time when it’s working very well for the volume house builders – 90% of planning applications are approved and there are about a million unbuilt permissions.”', 'He added: “It’s about local democracy. When local people are walking down the street and come across a new development they didn’t know about, the answer will now be: ‘You should have been involved in the consultation eight years ago when the code was agreed.’', '“It’s diluting the democratic process. At the moment, people get two chances to be involved: once when the plan is made, and once when a planning application is submitted. Now they’ll only have a chance when the code is being prepared.”', 'Zack Simons, a planning barrister at Landmark chambers, said there was a lot to welcome in a move towards digitising the planning system but added that “literally nothing” trailed in Jenrick’s public statements could not already be achieved under the current planning system.', '“Promises of “radical reform” can grab headlines. But remember that of more than 400,000 planning applications which are determined every year, over 80% are granted permission and under 0.5% are appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.”', 'A government source said it was misleading to suggest planning rules were not an obstacle to building. “The [90%] approval statistic masks the numbers of people who are put off applying altogether because of how bureaucratic and difficult this is,” the source said.', 'However, little has been announced on what measures, if any, will be taken against developers who do not use the permission they have been granted.', 'The white paper takes aim at the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, which has acted as the basis for planning since it was passed by the Labour government of Clement Attlee.', 'A “complex” planning system has acted as a barrier to building the homes people need, said Jenrick. “We will cut red tape, but not standards, placing a higher regard on quality, design and the environment than ever before,” he said. “Planning decisions will be simple and transparent, with local democracy at the heart of the process. As we face the economic effects of the pandemic, now is the time for decisive action and a clear plan for jobs and growth.”', 'The Conservatives will hope the overhaul will be favoured not only by investors and developers, but also by the younger voters currently outside its reach.', 'The Tory manifesto commits the government to 300,000 new homes built every year and, before coronavirus hit, senior Tories saw housing as the key mission of the government as a way of targeting a primary concern of many under-40s and city-dwelling voters shut out of the housing market – those most likely to vote Labour.', '“We are seeing a huge generation divide on housing,” one Tory source said. “The under-40s may have half as much chance of owning a home. That is being directly addressed by the first homes programme but the broader point is this planning system has held back homes being built on land that is ready to be built on.', '“And we know the main concerns which local people may have are about good design, environmentally friendly, buildings that fit into the architectural landscape, ones people are proud to own.

', 'The government has sought to allay mounting fears about GCSE and A-level results, promising that the appeal process will ensure that students with exceptional circumstances are not held back by the way grades have been calculated. However, individual students will not be able to challenge the grades themselves.', 'In Scotland, where the results for higher exams came out on Tuesday, a quarter of teacher-predicted grades were marked down during the standardisation process, which takes into account a school’s prior attainment.', 'According to new clarification from the exam watchdog Ofqual, schools in England will be able to lodge appeals if they can show that grades are lower than expected because previous cohorts are not “representative” of this year’s students.', 'Critics of the Scottish system complained that pupils were being marked on their school’s record rather than on individual merit, putting high-performing pupils in historically low-attaining schools at a disadvantage and “baking in” the attainment gap, with disadvantaged students’ results downgraded by a greater margin than their more affluent peers.', 'Ofqual said schools and colleges in England would be able to appeal if they could prove that historical data used to standardise grades was not a reliable indicator of this year’s results due to a change of circumstances. Examples given include schools where there has been a significant change in leadership, where objective evidence can be provided that previous grades are unlikely to be representative.', 'Ofqual also cites a switch from single-sex to co-educational, and schools that have experienced a “monumental event”, such as flooding or fire, resulting in relocation that may have brought down one year’s results in the historical data.', 'In guidance published a week ahead of A-level results day, Ofqual confirmed that individual pupils would not be allowed to challenge grades themselves – unlike in Scotland – and that their schools and colleges would need to appeal against results on their behalf. Pupils can, however, submit allegations about bias or discrimination.', 'Exams were cancelled in both England and Scotland this summer as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, and teachers were asked to supply predicted grades and pupil rankings, which were then moderated using a statistical model designed to ensure consistency.', 'Ofqual has already said that this year’s results in England will be “slightly higher” overall than last year, though – as in Scotland – large numbers of teacher-predicted grades have been revised down, which is likely to cause widespread disappointment among pupils and their teachers.', 'The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the “disastrous” handling of results in Scotland showed “what can go wrong when computer algorithms drive students’ grades, and politicians wash their hands of responsibility”.', 'She said: “Young people deserve to have their hard work assessed on merit, but the system risks baking in inequality and doing most harm to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those from ethnic minority groups, and those with special educational needs and disabilities.”', 'Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “No system could be a perfect substitute for real exams, but I welcome the appeals guidance confirmed by Ofqual today, to make the process as fair as possible and make sure all students get a grade that allows them to progress.', '“It is vital that students with exceptional circumstances are not held back by the way grades have been calculated – including those who are highly talented in schools that have not in the past had strong results, or where schools have undergone significant changes, such as a new leadership team.

The fees, called Section 106 payments, are often a condition for permission being granted but the proposals envisage temporarily lifting a “small sites threshold”, below which developers will not need to contribute to affordable housing, to up to 40 or 50 units.', 'A new national levy would replace the system of developer contributions and be charged according to the final development value of the project.', 'Insisting that more social housing would be the outcome, Boris Johnson told reporters on a visit to a housing development in Warrington: “This solution gives [builders] a much simpler infrastructure levy that enables them to go ahead and build a much bigger chunk of affordable housing and help people on to the property ladder.”', 'But the National Housing Federation called for clarity on what would replace the Section 106 agreements, which last year delivered almost 28,000 affordable homes, about half of the total. Kate Henderson, the chief executive, questioned how a replacement national levy would enable the “levelling up” of communities.', 'The local government association for Greater London warned that the changes were potentially disastrous and could reduce the amount of affordable housing built.', '“London is suffering the most severe homelessness crisis in the country and the chronic shortage of affordable housing is at the heart of this,” said Darren Rodwell, executive member for housing and planning at London Councils.', 'He also warned that lower-quality and fewer affordable homes could arise from a “planning free-for-all”, as critics rounded on the plans for new homes, hospitals and schools to be allowed automatically in areas designated for “growth”..', 'Jenrick dismissed allegations that the proposals to speed up building could create a new generation of low-quality homes, calling them “complete nonsense”. He insisted local people would be able to make “a meaningful contribution”, despite confirming there was nothing that could be done to halt disliked projects in areas zoned for growth.', 'Jenrick again admitted that he wished he had not sat next to the developer Desmond at an event which subsequently saw him embroiled in controversy this year. The tycoon donated £12,000 to the Tories after a new housing development was given a green light by Jenrick the day before a new community infrastructure levy was introduced. In court, the housing minister accepted that his decision was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”.', 'Labour sought to apply fresh fire to Jenrick on Thursday over the controversy, alleging he was “supremely arrogant to think he has any moral authority to lead these reforms, which put power in the hands of the developers that bankroll the Conservative party”.', 'Steve Reed MP, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said: “Robert Jenrick moved heaven and earth to help a multi-billionaire Tory donor, Richard Desmond, avoid paying vital infrastructure funding to one of the most deprived boroughs in the country – now he wants to legislate to prevent more of the Tories’ developer friends from paying their dues.”', 'Jenrick told BBC Radio 4 he had no idea how much property developers had donated to the Tories in the past year.

A new body would be set up to help deliver design codes at a local level in line with the work of the late Conservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton.', 'But the Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, who represents the Cotswolds, said he was concerned about the quality of new homes which could be built. He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “Whilst I’m all in favour of building more houses they need to be good-quality houses, we have got to be really sure that we are not building slums of tomorrow by building today at low quality.”', 'Bob Colenutt, a housing expert, also suggested that new red tape might be produced with the addition of the administrative criterion of “beauty”.', 'He added: “The design codes will be front loaded, so consultations take place at the outset, with local people having little chance to change them then over a 10-year period. It purports to create more democracy but actually it reduces it.”', 'Other proposals promise to make greater use of technology to give individuals and neighbourhoods a greater say in the planning process, such as by standardising plans and applications and making them easy to access on smartphones.', 'There was a warm welcome from the National Federation of Builders (NFB), which said the moves vindicated its evidence and solutions.', 'Rico Wojtulewicz, of the NFB’s housing building division, said: “For the last five years we have campaigned for design codes, flat-rate planning contributions, better land assembly, especially through Homes England, digitised planning, a greater appreciation of what the best builders, our SMEs, deliver, and a certain planning system.

His joint submission said: “We believe that there is clear evidence of factional activity by senior paid employees of the party against the elected leadership of the time.”', 'They allege that in 2017 hostile officials set up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course, which included starving potential target seats of money and focusing resources on MPs not allied to Corbyn.', 'If claims in the report of significant sums of money being spent on such actions without authority are correct, then the inquiry must consider “whether it may have constituted fraudulent activity”, the submission said.', 'More generally, the joint statement condemns what it calls a “toxic culture” at Labour headquarters, saying this is demonstrated by the WhatsApp messages.', 'One of the officials blamed by Corbyn told the Guardian the submission was not true. “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence,” the official said.', '“Pro-Corbyn staff inspected tens of thousands of former staff emails in January 2020 to try and find evidence of their ridiculous conspiracy theory. They found nothing because it is not real. They are trying to build a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves of the consequences of their incompetence.”', 'In contrast, the official said, there were emails showing Corbyn’s team tried to push election resources in 2017 towards protecting loyalist MPs in safe seats, at the expense of marginal constituencies.', 'The Guardian has separately seen the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage. They allege that the leaked report misused their WhatsApp messages to falsely make them seem racist and sexist, and confirm they are suing Labour for data protection breaches and libel over the document.', 'Mark Lewis of Patron Law, who is representing some of the Labour officials, said: “It would not be appropriate to make comment at this stage. The matters are before the Forde inquiry and will be the subject of litigation.”', 'The Corbyn document also talks about a general “daily hostility and obstruction” by officials towards the then leader and his team.', 'In a separate submission to the inquiry, a former Labour press officer and adviser to McDonnell made similar allegations. Joe Ryle said he witnessed a “constant battle” with Labour HQ over appointing staff, and routine briefings to the media against Corbyn. In his submission, also seen by the Guardian, Ryle wrote: “Work colleagues of mine would regularly turn up to meetings with party staff and by the time they got back to their desks the contents of the meeting had already been leaked to journalists.”']","Jeremy Corbyn","News","2020-08-07",17.54,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3985db4121351edd533db0dcd040f608b059ec5/0_118_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4e05b0ba1ade0f9591ccd7ba883e24f2","Corbyn made the accusations in a joint submission to the party’s inquiry into a leaked Labour report.

  ["Corbyn's constituents reflect on latest twist in antisemitism row","['Islington North citizens praise ‘fantastic MP’ but some say former Labour leader ‘could have done more’ on issue']","['Around this time last year, Jeremy Corbyn was launching his general election campaign at the Brickworks community centre in his Islington North constituency, and talking of leading the country into a better future.', 'On Wednesday, Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer, denied him readmission to the parliamentary party. And at Brickworks, director Colin Adams groaned in disbelief.', '“That’s disappointing,” he said. “Wow, that’s really disappointing. He is just a fantastic MP, he’s so important to people around here. I think there will be a sense of outrage.”', 'Adams said that on antisemitism, Corbyn “could have done more”, but said that he was commenting first and foremost as a community activist. ', '“For people round here, disadvantaged by finance, class, education, he is amazing. If he says he’s going to do something – pop his head into a community meeting or campaign against racism – he’ll do it come what may, whatever his commitments. He doesn’t go back on his word. For him not to be a Labour MP, it’s not going to bring the party back together.”', 'At that 2019 launch, Corbyn said he loved “walking along the Seven Sisters Road, I have many friends around the area – the cafes, the shops.” He won 64% of the vote locally, even as he led his party to national defeat. And around the busy thoroughfare on Wednesday afternoon, most people loved him back.', '“He’s a very good MP, I have nothing bad to say about Jeremy,” said Audrey Mason-Brown, a 63-year-old shop manager. “I’ve lived round here for over 30 years and Jeremy has been a rock. If he’s going past he stops and talks to you, if you have a problem you can bring it to him. He’s not one of these upmarket hoity-toity MPs, he’s an ordinary person.”', 'Mason-Brown, a Labour member, viewed Starmer’s decision as the latest example of unfairness in the party’s treatment of Corbyn. “I even think of leaving the party,” she added. “As soon as Jeremy leaves this constituency, I’ll stop voting.”', 'Niamh, a more recent arrival in her 20s who moved to the area a year ago, echoed Mason-Brown’s view, describing Corbyn as “thoughtful, caring, more realistic somehow – more like a normal person – than most politicians”. On antisemitism, she added: “Corbyn has been used as a scapegoat. I think Keir Starmer is using this as an opportunity to stick the knife in a little bit.”', 'As a floating voter between Labour and the Greens, she felt disenchanted by the new leadership, she suggested. “I guess it’s more likely that Labour will get into power now, but not for the reasons I would like.”', 'But not every constituent was on Corbyn’s side. Anna, laden with shopping as she returned to her home on the Andover estate, shook her head sceptically when asked to give her view of her MP. On antisemitism and in general, she said: “There’s something just not quite right about that man.”', 'She has voted Labour in the area for 40 years, but “didn’t really think much about Corbyn at all” until he became leader, she said. “The more you heard about him, and the more he’s on the news, he stands up there speaking, and you think, please sit down.” Then she paused for a moment, and added: “I suppose he did good, in his way.”', 'For Theo Clay, a charity consultant and Labour member who said he was relieved the Corbyn era was over, there was little equivocation. “I think Starmer was probably right to do it,” he said.', 'Whatever his qualities as a local MP, he added, his reaction to the antisemitism crisis could not be dismissed. “It feels like with everything that’s happened up to this point, he can’t get away with half apologies any more. If Corbyn wasn’t willing to be fully contrite about everything that happened under his leadership, there was really no other choice if you wanted a clean break.”']","Labour","News","2020-11-18",16.01,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322dd0440faf46bc1dab3b2f1b06b328fe175bd4/0_193_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d937184cb1a6e9a5760674ecebcfb971","Colin Adams said of Corbyn: ‘For people round here, disadvantaged by finance, class, education, he is amazing.’ Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian","['Archie Bland']","Archie Bland is the editor of the Guardian's First Edition newsletter","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/18/corbyns-constituents-reflect-on-latest-twist-in-antisemitism-row","['Jeremy Corbyn', 'Islington North', 'Colin Adams']",272  ],

Officials had originally expected thousands to apply and estimated that the government might eventually have to pay out between £200m and £570m. At least nine people have died before receiving compensation they applied for.', 'The Home Office said it rejected any suggestion that the scheme was discriminatory.', 'Ankrah’s concerns were echoed by whistleblowers from the Lessons Learned review, who felt uneasy that entrenched Home Office styles of working made staff insensitive on the issue of race. “The irony was that the very review team that was investigating what the Home Office thinks is past injustice was doing it in a way that was upholding all the systemic racism that exists in the Home Office,” one team member who was interviewed as part of the internal investigation said.', 'Ankrah worked as a head of policy in the Windrush compensation scheme from its launch in March 2019 until April 2020, when she resigned and moved to another Home Office department. She left the Home Office entirely in August 2020 to take up a job in the NHS.', 'She said she raised concerns to her bosses on several occasions about what she felt was systemic racism within the scheme. “It’s not just racism. It is an unwillingness to look with any curiosity or genuine concern at the situation of victims, many of whom were elderly and unwell,” she said. As a result, a group of predominantly black and Asian people were being “re-traumatised” by the compensation scheme, she said.', 'She said a senior colleague criticised her for always seeing “things through the prism of race” and she was censured for “standing outside and throwing stones in”.', 'As the only black senior member of the team, she was “irritated” by these rebukes, asking: “[If] I was throwing stones from the outside – who put me on the outside?” She felt her role on the compensation team was marginalised and that her “experiences as a black person, as a professional, were diminished or devalued”.', '“I am not a disgruntled employee; I am not bringing an employment tribunal claim – this was not about my job. It was about meeting this government’s promise to put right the harm that many people had suffered,” she said.', 'She described accepting the role because she wanted to help with the process of ensuring justice for the Windrush generation, but quickly becoming concerned about the team’s capacity to deliver it.', 'Ankrah proposed a simplified, plain-English version of the compensation application form, as well as greater understanding towards the families of those people who died before completing a claim. She also made suggestions about how to assist widows and children.', 'She said she wanted to help people to prove that their treatment had a detrimental impact on their lives but that her recommendations were ignored. “The scheme was intended to allow people to make their own applications, without the need for legal advice. But the guidance was poor; this meant it was not fit for purpose.”', 'Ankrah’s main concern was that many in the team working on compensation had immigration enforcement backgrounds, or were still working in that section of the Home Office. “These were the very same people who hadn’t questioned the Windrush situation in the first place,” she said. “It is unusual, is it not, to have the same bit of the organisation in charge of the complaints? You normally have some type of separation at least to show credibility.”', 'Ankrah was also troubled by numerous comments that she believed were revealing about attitudes of Home Office employees. She said staff were grudging about payments and told her: “People should be happy with whatever they get.” She added: “A Home Office lawyer was telling me: ‘If they die without a will then too bad, they should have made a will.’”', 'When she tried to help speed up payment for a terminally ill claimant, colleagues began “discussing whether he should be paid a trifling sum or a very trifling sum”. She felt some of the comments “betrayed a complete lack of humanity”.', 'Amid growing concerns about the running of the programme, the Commons home affairs committee announced on Wednesday that it was launching an inquiry into the compensation scheme. The first evidence session is expected next month.', 'Three separate teams were established to right the wrongs against the Windrush generation in 2018. Alongside the compensation scheme, the Windrush taskforce has been widely praise for swiftly giving documentation to about 13,000 people who had wrongly been designated as illegal immigrants.', 'Separately, BAME staff working on the Windrush Lessons Learned review – the third unit established in the wake of the scandal – said they were concerned they were not invited to key workshops and were given non-speaking roles at meetings, whistleblowers told the Guardian.', 'After staff members attempted to raise concerns internally, a complaint was made to the chair of the Home Office’s race board. As a result, a Home Office human resources team was instructed to do some work to ensure that the team was “leading the way in creating inclusive working environments”.', 'An internal investigation was also launched, and about 20 members of staff working on the review were interviewed at length in early 2019 by a civil servant with a responsibility for equality and diversity. The conclusions of the internal investigation were not shared with the team, though it is understood to have looked at the lack of inclusion.', 'Who are the Windrush generation?', 'They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.', 'What happened to them?', 'An estimated 50,000 people faced the risk of deportation if they had never formalised their residency status and did not have the required documentation to prove it.\\xa0', 'Why now?', \"It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\\xa0to make the UK 'a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants'. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.\", 'Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?', 'Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.', 'What did the government try and do to resolve the problem?', 'A Home Office team\\xa0was set up to ensure Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally. But a month after one minister promised the cases would be resolved within two weeks,\\xa0many remained destitute. In November 2018 home secretary Sajid Javid revealed that at least 11 Britons who had been wrongly deported had died. In April 2019 the government agreed to pay up to £200m in compensation.', \"By the end of 2020, victims were describing the long waits and 'abysmal' payouts with the scheme, and the most senior black Home Office employee in the team responsible for the Windrush compensation scheme resigned, describing it as systemically racist and unfit for purpose.\", 'The Wendy Williams Lessons Learned review into the causes of the Windrush scandal was published in March 2020 and is highly critical of the Home Office, although there was controversy about a decision not to describe the department as institutionally racist – a term reported to have been present in earlier drafts.', 'The final version does, however, condemn “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race” within the Home Office, and includes four recommendations for how the department can improve its record on race, diversity and inclusion.', 'A Home Office spokesperson said the department would not comment on individual staffing matters, but added: “We take any allegations of racism very seriously and any accusation is thoroughly investigated by the department.', '“We reject any suggestion that the Windrush compensation scheme is discriminatory or that it does not support victims. It was designed with victims’ interests at heart and to cover every conceivable circumstance in which a person may have found themselves.

One report suggested the sum could be £14bn extra over the next four years, implying a settlement well above inflation.', 'The MoD’s budget for 2020-21 is £41.5bn, and the Conservative party promised in its election manifesto last year to lift spending by 0.5 percentage points above inflation each year during the parliament, implying an increase in spending of about £500m next year.', 'But that promise was made before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, leaving the public finances decimated, and it had been unclear if it would hold.', 'The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he welcomed reports that the MoD could get an above-inflation settlement, tweeting: “Diplomacy is often cold-hearted and transactional so post-Brexit we will need to have something to bring to the table. What better than our world-class armed forces?”', 'This week it emerged that the Treasury wanted to abandon a long-held commitment to keep aid spending at 0.7% of GDP and cut it to 0.5%. The change would cost a few billion on top of the £2.9bn that has already been lost from the budget as the economy has shrunk because of the pandemic.', 'The MoD has a shortfall of £13bn in its equipment budget, according to the National Audit Office. It wants to advance a host of drone-related projects, partly to emulate the success that countries such as Turkey have had with their own programmes. It also wants to upgrade Britain’s Trident nuclear warheads for the 2030s.', 'Experts say it is more expensive for the MoD to agree annual funding settlements because equipment programmes run over many years and need certainty of funding. Malcolm Chalmers, from the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: “So much of what the MoD does, particularly on procurement, relies on being able to write multi-year contracts with suppliers.

The total uplift is £21.5bn, the biggest defence increase since the early days of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership.', 'Johnson told MPs that the budget increase would allow the British military to invest in new technology, arguing that it would help soldiers in hostile territory to “be alerted to a distinct ambush by sensors or satellites or drones instantly transmitting a warning, using artificial intelligence to devise the optimal responses”.', 'He said the armed forces would be able to order “a swarm attack by drones paralysing the enemy with the weapons”, and that British warships and combat vehicles “will carry directed energy weapons” – a reference to emerging laser and radio frequency weapons.

  ["George Osborne criticised for wasting £50m on 'hi-tech' offices","['Decision to pick more expensive option for NCSC had ‘an emphasis on image’, says committee']","['George Osborne has been severely criticised by an influential parliamentary committee for wasting up to £50m of public money on plush central London offices for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).', 'The intelligence and security committee (ISC) said the decision to acquire workspace at Nova South in Victoria, central London, was unacceptable and had “an emphasis on image rather than cost”.', 'The then chancellor Osborne overruled advice from the national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant to force through the purchase of the office space located in property company Land Securities’ ultra-modern Nova development, a report released on Thursday has found.', 'The offices, close to the Houses of Parliament and New Scotland Yard, will cost £96m to lease over 15 years, while a fully costed alternative in Canary Wharf would have cost £46m over the same period.', 'ISC members Kevan Jones and Stewart Hosie said a better decision-making process would have benefited the public purse, and questioned why Lyall Grant had not sought a “ministerial direction” – a formal instruction from a minister to spend public money despite an objection from the spending officer – over the decision.', '“The role of ministers in the process as a whole was highly unsatisfactory, culminating in the then-chancellor overruling the then-national security adviser’s very strong advice to reject Nova South, in order to confirm what GCHQ had made clear was the only option that they would accept. In this regard we note that the then-national security adviser failed to seek a ministerial direction,” they said in a statement.', 'The creation of a National Cyber Security Centre was announced by Osborne in 2015. It was tasked with bolstering security against the growing online threats from around the globe.', 'A consultancy firm drew up a shortlist of 10 options for possible offices – three were taken from tech hubs, two were near Westminster, and five were newly introduced options from within the existing agency and Ministry of Defence (MoD) property portfolio.', 'The shortlist scored Canary Wharf – a property already leased by the government – as the top option, with new-build commercial properties in Nova South and Shoreditch coming joint second, followed by an existing agency-owned building.', 'Shortly afterwards, GCHQ decided that Nova South was its preferred option, with Canary Wharf as the alternative fall-back option.', 'On 26 April 2016, Robert Hannigan, the director of GCHQ, wrote to Lyall Grant to request his formal approval, as principal accounting officer for the agencies, for the draft full business case for Nova South.', 'On 4 May 2016, Lyall Grant wrote to the chancellor, in his capacity as chair of the national security council sub-committee on cyber. He wrote: “From an accounting officer perspective, [Nova South] causes me some concern, both on value for money and deliverability grounds. I would therefore advise against agreement unless there are other considerations of ministerial and public expectation which have not been fully brought out in the business case.”', 'Crucially – given the importance that had been placed on a launch date in October – Lyall Grant found that Nova South was not deliverable within the specified timeframe.', '“The letter is comprehensive and unequivocal. As principal accounting officer for the agencies – and therefore answerable to parliament for their spending – the national security adviser opposed the choice of Nova South,” the report noted.', 'Soon after this advice was sent, Lyall Grant met Osborne to discuss this issue – but no note of the meeting could be found, which the committee said was “highly surprising”.', '“We are informed that no note of this meeting can be found. We find this highly surprising, given that private secretaries would routinely attend and minute meetings their ministers held. However, we have been informed that meetings between the NSA and the chancellor were not regularly minuted,” the report said.', 'On 18 May 2016, Osborne’s private office emailed the NSA. It read: “Based on your discussion last week and the further information provided by GCHQ, the chancellor understands that the options presented in their business case are finely balanced. While [Canary Wharf] is cheaper, the chancellor’s view is that Nova South meets more of the criteria for the NCSC, in that it presents a more modern, hi-tech image and is closer to Whitehall and agency partners.”', 'In the report, Jones and Hosie continued: “From the outset, the selection criteria used were faulty.', '“Locations outside London were never considered, and great emphasis was placed on finding high-end accommodation – without any case being made for that being necessary.', '“Even disregarding the faulty criteria, it is clear that GCHQ selected Nova South against all the evidence – and warnings that it would neither be ready on time nor receive approval from the government property unit.', '“Nova South was around double the cost of typical government accommodation in London: this was allowed to happen because the scoring system which GCHQ chose significantly underweighted costs and overweighted location.”', 'The ISC said the cost of Nova South equates to more than “£21,000 per staff member per annum” – more than double the average government cost for London-based staff. The funding originally allocated for the NCSC’s office stood at £3.5m per year.Boris Johnson said the government “acknowledges there are lessons that can be learned from the procurement process” and would respond to the committee’s recommendations in due course.', 'In a written statement he said: “ Nova South met all the key criteria required by government, including proximity to Whitehall and other stakeholders within the government secure zone.', '“A further contributing factor to its selection was its availability, which allowed the NCSC to be established at pace, within a year, providing a centre at a time when there was an urgent need for the government to increase its defensive cyber capabilities and respond to global cyber incidents like WannaCry.', '“Nova South has provided a much-needed central focus for UK cybersecurity since its procurement, hosting a wide range of government and industry partners as well as contributing to our global commitment to cybersecurity and the UK’s ranking as number one by the global cybersecurity index.”']","George Osborne","News","2020-11-19",13.3,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a28570689fbd249e08bae837ef0b510335080b5b/0_132_2471_1483/master/2471.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=80ba15afc61bfed0273a78e678778c98","George Osborne in 2015, the year he announced the creation of a National Cyber Security Centre.

  ["Criminal justice system is 'on its knees', says top English lawyer","['Criminal Bar Association chair says funding cuts punishing victims more than criminals']","['Crown court cases are being delayed until 2023, the innocent penalised more than the guilty, and the under-funded, criminal justice system brought “on its knees”, according to the chair of the Criminal Bar Association in England and Wales.', 'James Mulholland QC told the Guardian that while Covid had intensified the crisis, deep cuts to the Ministry of Justice since 2010 had left it dangerously under-resourced.', 'The result was that “very vulnerable people who have to go through the system are being let down,” he said. “You can’t have a completely under-funded system from beginning to end.”', 'Mulholland, 56, represents thousands of barristers who are struggling to hold the system together during the pandemic, but is still immersed in trial processes himself, and witness to the crisis first hand.', 'Approximately 50,000 crown court cases are waiting to be heard, of which 33,000 will involve full trials. Last year, without Covid, Mulholland pointed out, the crown courts managed to complete only 12,000 trials.', '“The system is in logjam,” he said. “We are having some cases listed into 2023 for trials where people are being released on bail, sometimes for offences like rape, sexual offences, affray and significant burglaries.', '“Sentencing judges are now entitled to take into account the Covid experience [and deliver reduced prison terms] – so while the innocent may be held longer [in custody awaiting] trial, the guilty are benefitting [from coronavirus].', '“We are holding people in custody for up to 18 months. There’s no compensation if they are found not guilty. We have 17-year-olds who are not going to be tried until 2023. Will they have to spend their youth waiting for an outcome that will impact their whole life?”', 'He said while the government talked of being tough on sentencing, only 7% of offending recorded by the police resulted in a prosecution.', '“There’s a one in 50 chance of an old-age pensioner who is burgled seeing that person brought to justice. The police don’t have the resources. Only 1–1.5% of [reported] rapes result in charges. And even then it’s 1,319 days for the average rape case to go through the system from actual offence to completion.”', 'Mullholland said he feared the criminal justice system was in danger of losing the public’s confidence, generating miscarriages of justice and alienating victims. Even before the pandemic, the backlog of cases was growing because the courts service saved money by limiting the number of judges’ sitting days.', 'His diagnosis of the root cause of the problems hampering the criminal justice system is one thing: lack of money.', 'All the main professional legal bodies agree with that analysis.', 'The lord chief justice, Sir Ian Burnett, has also called for increased funding. “There must be sufficient resources to enable the courts and tribunals to work to full capacity … otherwise backlogs [of cases] will be unsustainable,” he told the Bar Council.', 'The cash required, he said, was “little more than a rounding error in [the budgets of] many departments”. If withholding money from the courts prevented people resuming their normal lives and working, he added, it was “a false economy”.', 'Mulholland said an extra £250m a year was needed to solve the problem, a figure derived from an Institute for Government assessment.', 'While extra funding has recently been provided to boost the numbers of police and prosecutors, no equivalent resources have been granted to barristers.', 'Instead, criminal barristers had faced cuts to fees of between 30% and 40% over the past 12 years, Mulholland said. ', 'Diversity at the Bar was also suffering, he noted, because women were leaving mid-career when they realised it was not a profession in which they could have both a family life and receive decent pay.', 'Mulholland grew up in Salford. His parents, from Northern Ireland and the Republic, were teachers who inculcated in him a sense of the importance of justice. ', 'His family home was “educationally rich but not well off”. That encouraged him to enter the law on behalf of “the underdog – whether they are the defendant or victim”.', 'After Leeds University, he studied for the Bar in London. As well as arguing cases, he sometimes sits as a crown court recorder – a part-time judge.', 'His experiences in court concern him: “We are seeing more litigants in person [unrepresented defendants] now as a result of legal aid entitlement thresholds [not being increased in line with inflation].', '“They appear in quite serious cases. It’s become progressively worse. It’s so short-sighted. Trials involving [unrepresented defendants] take double or treble the time. It’s a false economy [not granting them legal aid].”', 'Mulholland said he was also concerned about the increase in alleged victims refusing to “cooperate with the police because they feel they won’t receive proper treatment”.', '“Funding is crucial. We are on our knees. Under-funding risks miscarriages of justice. We need to fund the prosecution as well as the defence. Everyone needs to be paid more.”', 'Where, he asked, was the royal commission on criminal justice that the government promised when it took office in 2019? Glancing around the marble halls of the Old Bailey from which the late afternoon light was fading, he observed: “This was built when justice was taken seriously.”']","UK criminal justice","News","2020-11-19",12.59,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097b80e525962bbd41df89a791cbbb0edcb82724/0_407_6677_4007/master/6677.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=666141abf333c1b540796e82741697eb","James Mulholland QC says an extra £250m a year is needed to solve the problems caused by underfunding over the last decade.

In those circumstances, I have taken the decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn. I will keep this situation under review.”', 'Corbyn was suspended over a statement he issued following the publication of the EHRC report on 29 October, in which he said the problem of antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”.', 'In a “clarification” submitted to the NEC and made public this week, Corbyn said claims of antisemitism had not been “exaggerated”.', 'Starmer made his decision after speaking to Hodge on Tuesday evening.

This criticism has been joined by that from other MPs, no doubt following the lead of the leader.”The letter said the NEC panel received legal advice on the day about the sanction given to Corbyn. “This is an unacceptable attack on the lay volunteers elected to uphold the rule book, it is direct political interference and it is unacceptable.”It said the party would now face legal action as a result of the decision and said it was “unconscionable” that NEC members should be put in this position.It called on Evans to reprimand Starmer for his actions, which it says were “intended to undermine confidence in the dispute process and for taking a decision that is directly contradictory to the NEC panel decision”.', 'Corbyn’s lawyers have also written to Labour calling for him to be allowed back into the parliamentary party.

He has requested a review.', 'Morgan moved aged 10 from Jamaica to the UK in 1960, before Jamaican independence, travelling on a British passport. He attended school in London and lived and worked in the UK for more than 30 years until 1994 when he travelled to a relative’s funeral in Jamaica. On his way back to London he was stopped at check-in and his passport confiscated.', 'He was unable to persuade officials at the British high commission that they had made a mistake, and he remained stuck in Jamaica for a quarter of a century until the Windrush scandal broke, when British diplomats called him out of the blue to offer him a temporary visa to allow him to travel back to the UK. He applied for British citizenship in 2018, during his first visit home.', 'His application was rejected, after a delay of almost two years, on the grounds that he had been out of the country on a date five years before he made the application (at a time when he was barred from being in the UK because of the decision to confiscate his passport), and that he had spent more than 450 days out of the country during the application period (a period when he was not allowed to be in the UK).', '“I am sorry to tell you that you do not meet the requirements for citizenship and you do not have an entitlement to the right of abode in the United Kingdom,” the decision letter states.', 'Morgan said he was horrified by the decision. “How can you prevent someone from returning, then turn their application down and tell them you were not in the country and therefore are not eligible? Hello? Hello? Why was I not in the country? It makes no sense,” Morgan said, by telephone from Jamaica. He said he had become sceptical about repeated Home Office commitments to righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation. ', '“The promised change of culture hasn’t happened. When we take the limelight away from the Home Office, they revert back to their old ways.”', 'After being barred from returning to the UK, Morgan was destitute on the streets of Kingston for a while before managing to start a small business, and retraining as a graphic designer.

Neither Ken nor his lawyers can now have any confidence in statements by a succession of home secretaries that they are committed to providing justice for those who have been so severely injured by decades of hostile policies implemented by the Home Office,” she said.', 'A Home Office spokesperson said: “An independent review, which was requested last month into Mr Morgan’s case, is ongoing.

Deterrent fines will be imposed on firms that do not show due diligence in cleaning up their supply chains, he said.', 'The aim, he told MPs, was to “ensure no company that profits from forced labour in Xinjiang can do business in the UK, that no UK business is involved in their supply chains”.', 'He also proposed a review of export controls to Xinjiang province – the region in which tens of thousands of Uighur Muslims have been detained; new guidance to companies operating in the province; and a commitment that the Modern Slavery Act will be extended to the public sector.', 'Raab also said the government was reviewing the role of China’s Confucius Institutes operating in British academic institutions.', 'But the foreign secretary held back from imposing sanctions against any individual Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses, saying “he will keep that in reserve”.', 'The tightening up of the Modern Slavery Act, including company-reporting requirements, largely follows the recommendations of a government-commissioned report, overseen by the MP Frank Field, and published in May 2019 that found many companies treated the act as a box-ticking exercise. Critics said the review merely imposes fines if companies with an annual turnover of more than £36m do not produce an annual report.', 'His package is likely to be seen as the bare minimum by critics of Chinese human rights, and will do little to stem a potential rebellion by those critics demanding that the government endorse amendments passed in the Lords that make human rights a central consideration in future trade deals.', 'Labour’s Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the robustness of Raab’s words had not been matched by his actions, adding there was little that was new and “amounted to tinkering around the edges”. Far from going further than any other country, she said France had already gone further than the UK.', 'But the scale of Raab’s criticisms of China were striking, accusing the country of “extensive and invasive surveillance targeting minorities, systematic restrictions on Uighur culture, education, and the practice of Islam, and the widespread use of forced labour”. Satellite imagery showed the scale of the internment camps, the presence of factories inside them, and the destruction of mosques, he said.', 'Describing the position as harrowing, he added: “The nature and conditions of detention violate basic standards of human rights and, at their worst, amount to torture. Internment camps, arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture, forced sterilisation.\\u2028All on an industrial scale. It is truly horrific. Barbarism we all hoped was lost to another era.”', 'He said he had discussed with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, UK proposals for a UN human rights commissioner to be allowed to go to the province to examine the allegations of forced labour. He said without such a visit it is difficult to determine if “the tenable plausible and credible reports of forced labour” were true, he said. China has rejected the proposal, prompting Raab to claim “China cannot simply refuse all access to those trusted third party bodies who could verify the facts, and at the same time maintain a position of credible denial”.', 'In the Commons, Raab came under the most pressure over whether he will give a role to UK Judges to make a pre-determination on whether genocide is being committed in Xinjiang, and if so, refuse to negotiate any free-trade agreement with China, a measure that has already been inserted into the trade bill in the Lords.', 'Critics say Raab’s current position leads to a cul de sac as the international courts are not able to determine if genocide is occurring due to China’s refusal to refer the issue to the international court of justice.', 'Luke de Pulford, of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: “The measures to tighten the Modern Slavery Act do not stop companies not telling the truth about slavery in their supply chains. Companies like HikVision and Huawei have been accused of helping Uighur oppression, but this issue is not addressed in their modern slavery statements, and these statements do nothing to address that.”', 'The China Research Group of Tory MPs welcomed the plans to review the UK’s export controls.']","Uyghurs","News","2021-01-12",16.33,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8ab585711ff01fd7e32659f411fcb1738fac91/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7f11b564c7a524ded2cb63d67a57dad9","Bound and blindfolded inmates, likely Uighurs, being transferred at a train station in Xinjiang in 2018.

  ["Paul Dennett: the 'sensible socialist' seeking to transform Salford","['Mayor of the 18th most deprived council area in the country says trickle-down economics has not worked']","['Given the extent of the Conservative landslide in last year’s general election, one would be forgiven for believing that socialism in Britain was dead and buried – at least until 2025.', 'But in one northern English city, socialism – and indeed Corbynism – is alive and kicking.', 'Four years after being elected on a manifesto to tackle social injustice and poverty, the Salford city mayor, Paul Dennett, still lives in the same two-bed council flat he moved into long before becoming a politician. He is unrepentant about living in social housing when there is a long waiting list locally, believing it is all part of creating an equal society.', '“When you look at the history of what social housing or council housing was all about, it was very much about where doctors and shopkeepers and cleaners could all coexist and live and create vibrant and sustainable communities and that’s what we’re trying to create now in the city of Salford,” he said.', 'Dennett is against trickle-down economics and outsourcing: in January, Salford council brought planning, building control, property, highways and infrastructure services back in-house, ending a 15-year joint-venture partnership with Capita and Galliford Try.', 'He rejects gentrification, recently celebrating the council’s purchase of Islington Mill, a popular arts venue, using £3.3m of EU money, by saying: “This is about protecting and cultivating the production of culture – not just the consumption of culture. Ownership is key and, moving forward, the project we are embarking on with the Mill will be crucial in creating models for communities to resist gentrification. It’s about putting power into the hands of local communities.”', 'Salford’s sharp-suited city mayor is a member of Momentum and a good friend of Jeremy Corbyn as well as Rebecca Long-Bailey, a local MP and Corbyn’s former shadow business secretary.', 'He describes himself as a “sensible socialist” and “much more of an interventionist” than others in Greater Manchester, having more in common with Matthew Brown, his counterpart up the M6 in Preston, who decided to spend as much of taxpayers’ money as possible locally in a public procurement policy now known as the Preston model.', 'After taking office in May 2016, one of Dennett’s first moves was to make Salford council an accredited living wage employer. In October, it increased the pay of care workers to £9 an hour and ultimately wants to pay them the real living wage (currently £9.30 per hour).', 'Over the past year, the city has invested £126m into green spaces, has shamed the rest of Greater Manchester with its ambitious cycling and walking plans and has started to build a solar farm and hydro-electric schemes in the River Irwell to power 638 homes.', 'Last year, Dennett launched Dérive, a company set up to build affordable accommodation to rent. It is named after a Marxist psycho-geographical concept developed by Guy Debord, a French philosopher so dedicated to disruption that he insisted his first book was bound with a sandpaper cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it. The rough idea of Dérive was to challenge the alienation between people and their natural environment by creating vibrant active places.', 'In December, Dérive announced the largest council housing scheme for 50 years in Salford – 417 new council and community-owned homes, with the potential for 3,000 more. Dennett’s administration has previously been criticised for letting developers build huge blocks with no provision for affordable housing.', 'Salford has a long socialist history. It was there, sent from his native Germany to work in his family’s mill in the suburb of Weaste in the 1840s, that Friedrich Engels turned against unregulated capitalism, witnessing “women made unfit for childbearing, children deformed, men enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with disease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the bourgeoisie”.', 'Almost 200 years on, Salford is the 18th most deprived local authority in England. It is a borough of extremes – footballers including Ryan Giggs live in gated mansions in Worsley, yet in the Broughton area, home to many Orthodox Jews and other ethnic minorities, health is so poor that male life expectancy is decreasing, with the average man dying aged just 71.6.', 'Dennett’s approach is markedly different from his counterpoint over the River Irwell in Manchester. Ever since the IRA bomb in 1996, Manchester’s long-standing leader, Sir Richard Leese, has followed a model of development built around city centre skyscrapers and huge land deals with foreign investors, which his critics say puts economic growth above all else.', 'As mayor of Salford, Dennett decided to do things differently. “I was seeing economic investment within Greater Manchester ,which, on the one hand is is really positive – money coming into Greater Manchester and creating jobs, creating opportunities, and creating interesting places to live, work, play, and visit,” he said. “But I’ve always been uneasy with the kind of trickle-down economic theory that has kind of characterised our economy, not just within Greater Manchester but within the entire United Kingdom.”', 'The Manchester model hasn’t worked for many Salfordians, suggests Dennett. “When you look at Salford, we’ve increased in terms of the government’s index of multiple deprivation. We’re the 18th most deprived local authority in the country now with the economic growth we’ve seen, so there’s clearly an issue with the form of economic growth. That growth now for me has to go hand in hand with economic reform.”', 'Next, he wants to bring more care homes back under local authority control. He insists he doesn’t want the council to do everything but says: “I’d like the council to be doing an awful lot more than what it is at the moment.”']","Salford","News","2021-01-12",15.59,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec81b3d1c7f608b91ca56fddf442f1d15ebe8c34/0_0_6192_3714/master/6192.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=da2473ee0f2183e59c1761033d63fc6d","Paul Dennett believes economic growth ‘has to go hand in hand with economic reform’.

The measures are likely to be used in operations against “county lines” drug gangs, as well as investigating suspected terror plots. Last year, the high court ruled police recruitment of children was lawful.', 'Though there are already some safeguards on the use of child spies, a coalition of cross-party peers, as well as the bishops, will push the government to go further at the debate in the House of Lords on Wednesday.', 'Opposition to the child spies guidance has been driven by the Labour MP Stella Creasy, backed by the charity Just For Kids Law, who have helped draft the amendment, which would block any operation where a child is asked to continue to commit criminal offences undercover if there was a risk of foreseeable harm to the child.', 'Creasy said: “When people think of spies, they think of James Bond – but the truth is children are increasingly being drawn into being asked to spy on people close to them.', '“This bill allows for when such covert sources can commit crimes – this amendment protects children being asked to do this except in very exceptional circumstances. If the government won’t accept it, then they need to explain why they want the right to put children in positions of harm for the sake of an investigation?”', 'The bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, who sits in the Lords, said: “Children of all ages deserve to be protected. Ideally no one under 18 should ever be used for covert intelligence but if they must be then it must be extremely rare and with thorough legal protections in place.”', 'Concerns have been raised because of the harm done to children who are asked to remain undercover in order to provide information to the police, which may for example mean they are asked to remain within a gang where they would be exposed to serious, violent offences.', 'A Home Office spokesperson said: “Juvenile covert human intelligence sources are used very rarely and only where careful consideration has been given to the welfare of the child.', '“It may be necessary to help remove the child and other young and vulnerable people from the cycle of crime that they are in. This includes helping to prevent and prosecute gang violence, drug dealing and the ‘county lines’ phenomenon which all have a devastating impact on young people and communities.', '“Their use is governed by a strict legal framework and is overseen by the investigatory powers commissioner. We are strengthening the safeguards which apply in the very rare cases that a child is tasked to participate in criminality to ensure that their best interests are always a primary consideration in the decision making process.”', 'Labour split again over the controversial bill on Monday, after the party’s leadership refused to back a separate Lords amendment from the former shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti.', 'She submitted the amendment for debate in the upper house on Monday, seeking to remove the immunity from criminal prosecution for undercover police and informants, saying that otherwise there would be “grave risk” of human rights abuses from agents acting undercover.

Johnson approved the sale of Paveway guided missiles in August 2016, a few days after an airstrike on a potato factory in the country had killed 14 civilians.', 'In 2019, the court of appeal halted the sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, arguing that ministers had not properly assessed the risk of civilian casualties from the bombing. But last summer, Liz Truss, the trade secretary, restarted arms sales after concluding there had been only “isolated incidents” of breaches of humanitarian law.', 'The money to support the Saudi military comes principally via the secretive Integrated Activity Fund, now renamed the Gulf Strategy Fund, a pool for money which the UK spends on the six cash-rich Gulf states. Its budget was £20m a year until the coronavirus crisis forced a sudden cut to £8.4m.', 'Ministers had until recently refused to disclose how the fund’s cash was spent, citing national security exemptions, amid accusations that it may be linked to serious human rights abuses. But in the last year there have been signs of greater transparency.', 'Last October, Cleverly told a Westminster Hall debate that the UK was confident “that we are having a significant positive impact on human rights in the region” because of the activity of the Gulf Strategy Fund, and promised its governance had been strengthened and that a summary of its work would be published.', 'The UK has long enjoyed a close military and strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia, providing arms via BAE Systems, generating £2.5bn to £3bn a year for the British company.', 'It also supplies direct military services, and has previously disclosed that 17 service personnel are embedded within the kingdom’s military, including three in its air operations centre.', 'But Day, the SNP MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, said the UK was “not content with merely profiting from arming Saudi Arabia’s brutal war on Yemen”.', 'He added: “I am shocked to find that the UK government has also covertly funnelled millions of pounds through secretive funds to train the Saudi armed forces.”', 'A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “The UK is not a member of the Saudi-led coalition and we have played no role in setting Saudi-led coalition policy.', '“Our defence relationship with Saudi Arabia includes training courses, advice and guidance.

And just to conflate the situation between geographical inequality and white working class and other minorities and protected characteristics is just a massive oversimplification and very political.”', 'He would not be drawn on the individual merits of his successor, Kishwer Falkner, or the new commissioners, saying he welcomed a variety of views but adding: “They do need to understand the role and function of the commission and that is to be independent.”', 'His own ideas for the EHRC’s future and the maintaining of its independence include increased funding, making the women and equalities select committee, rather than the secretary of state, responsible for appointing the EHRC board, and greater enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines, for example relating to gender pay gaps.', 'Isaac said these changes would help make the commission, which has had its budget reduced from £70m at its inception in 2007 to £17m, “more than independent in name” and address issues raised during his tenure. These include the absence of black commissioners, which Isaac said was not for want of trying on his part, having encouraged black applicants but having had no power to appoint them.', 'Addressing the EHRC’s decision to halt an investigation into Conservative party Islamophobia, Isaac said it was only a pause, while the Tories carried out their own inquiry.', '“It [the party inquiry] was due to report by the end of the year [2020] so I’m interested to know whether or not it has reported or whether it’s slipped,” he said.', '“My view is that the commission needs to look at the recommendations of that review and if it is unhappy with the approach that it’s taken and whether or not it is sufficiently independent and robust, if it’s not satisfied about those things, then it should investigate Islamophobia in the Tory party in the way that it investigated antisemitism in the Labour party.”', 'The government said it had nothing to add to Truss’s speech.']","Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)","News","2021-01-18",12,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06dc4b723d1564033a3effa9be713d4e8bb1bc0/0_316_5666_3401/master/5666.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=2874d8bc104179394e34fed2d105523a","David Isaac, former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

And looking further ahead, the decision on whether to keep the UC boost will help define whether this is to be a parliament of ‘levelling up’ living standards, or pushing up poverty.”', 'Conservative backbenchers representing 65 Northern seats, many of them ex-Labour “red wall” constituencies, have joined calls for the prime minister to cancel a planned reduction in the benefit.', 'Carlisle MP John Stevenson of the Northern Research Group told the Guardian: “While we are still in the pandemic, we’ve still got the consequences of coming through furlough – the implications of that – it would be far better to have a stable UC environment.”', '“Levelling up is about improving people’s lives, improving people’s standard of living, giving people greater opportunities. You could argue that the UC uplift is helping people get lifted.”', 'Labour has called an opposition day debate on the issue in the House of Commons on Monday, but Johnson has ordered his own MPs to boycott the vote rather than risk a significant rebellion.', 'In an extraordinary message sent to Conservative MPs, the prime minister claimed that after a previous opposition day debate on free school meals, Labour had used its “army of momentum trolls last time to misrepresent the outcome and to lie about its meaning and frankly to intimidate and threaten colleagues”.', 'He suggested the government would continue refusing to take part in what he called “vacuous opposition day debates” until Labour stopped “playing politics” and “inciting the worst kind of hatred and bullying”.', 'What is universal credit?', 'Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. With a huge influx due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, in September 2020 there were 5.6 million people claiming UC.', 'How long has it been around?', 'The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\\xa0management failures, expensive\\xa0IT blunders and design faults\\xa0mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and full rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.', 'What is the biggest problem?', 'The original design set out a\\xa0minimum 42-day wait for a first payment\\xa0to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\\xa0rent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\\xa0notable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\\xa0', 'Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.', 'Are there other problems?', 'Plenty.\\xa0Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\\xa0imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. ', \"Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. \", 'And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.', 'The debates are non-binding but they are a way for the opposition, which cannot set the agenda in the Commons, to raise questions of the day – and they can embarrass the government by forcing its MPs to take sides on an uncomfortable issue.', 'Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, told the Guardian the electorate would punish the Tories if they go ahead with the £20-a-week reduction in the incomes of 6 million families. “The voters will remember,” she said.', '“A lot of people are going to remember this because it’s not a little tweak here or there. It isn’t about, I can’t afford to send the kids on holiday. This is about, I’m going under, and I’m going under because of this government’s priorities and what they’ve done to me,” she said.', 'Recounting the story of a constituent who was a care worker who had gone back to work after being in intensive care with Covid because he was struggling to make ends meet, she added: “We’ve got to stop this cut to universal credit because it’s affecting our frontline key workers. It’s affecting people and families that need it the most.”', 'It is understood the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is considering a range of options for his 3 March budget, with any final confirmation likely to be delayed until after it is clear whether lockdown restrictions can begin to be lifted. “No decision has been made,” said the Treasury.', 'Sunak regards the uplift as an emergency measure, and it is understood that once the economy has begun to reopen, he would like to see the resources shifted towards helping the unemployed back into work.', 'But Stevenson, who said he has 8,500 UC claimants in his Carlisle constituency, many of them in work, said: “I understand that the government cannot make any commitment to making it permanent. I completely get that because we’ve got to look at the finances. I just think, continue it at least for the foreseeable future. That allows us to get a better understanding where we are, keeps people in a good place.”', 'When Johnson was asked about universal credit at last week’s hearing of the liaison committee of senior MPs, he said: “I think that what we want to see is jobs. We want people in employment and we want to see the economy bouncing back.', '“And I think most people in this country would rather see a focus on jobs and a growth in wages than focusing on welfare but clearly we have to keep all these things under review.”', 'The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government was hoping some rules could be loosened in March, depending on the success of the vaccine rollout and whether cases of the virus have begun falling consistently. Ministers are also waiting to see whether the vaccine prevents transmission of the disease.', 'Johnson has never precisely defined what “levelling up”, one of the key themes of his election campaign, actually means, or how he will measure whether he is succeeding.', 'Conservative thinktank Onward also called on Monday for the chancellor to consider reforming the tax system, including by making council tax fairer, to close the gap between north and south.', 'Onward’s director, Will Tanner, said, “if we don’t use the tax system as well as spending we’ll be trying to level up with one hand tied behind our back.

There are features of the economy which would suggest that could be quite significant, if you look at the level of household savings, for example, and data like that.”', 'The comments follow weekend newspaper reports that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to raise taxes in the 3 March budget in order to bring down record levels of government borrowing. Sunak has warned that “hard choices” must be made to fix the public finances, and used his spending review in November to freeze public-sector pay and cut the overseas aid budget.', 'The UK’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income plus other receipts – is on track to reach at least £394bn for the financial year ending in March, amid a rise in emergency spending during the crisis and collapse in tax receipts. The national debt – the sum total of every deficit – has risen to more than £2tn, equivalent to more than 100% of national output.', 'However, major tax increases might well provoke a swift Tory backlash. The chancellor has also been urged by leading economists to take advantage of record low borrowing costs and to steer clear of raising taxes or launching a renewed austerity drive to allow a sustainable economic recovery to take hold.

It also claims the issue is best determined in the international courts.', 'The backing of the IBA for the amendment is significant as the Foreign Office has been citing legal pitfalls in giving the high court a role in determining genocide.', 'In a letter to the foreign secretary, the IBA write: “There is no requirement under the Genocide Convention 1948, or any principle of international law, that requires a State to seek a determination of an international court, or other body acting under the auspices of the United Nations, that genocide has or is being committed before that State’s obligations under the Convention are engaged.', '“There is a real concern that this position is used, or may be used, to justify inaction in the face of credible evidence that genocide is occurring.”', 'The letter signed by Schona Jolly, the chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales, adds: “Waiting for a judicial determination by an international court or body that genocide has been committed or is being committed, where it is not apparent that there is any likely or realistic route to such a determination, undermines the object and purpose of the obligation to prevent: to ensure, in so far as is possible, that genocide is never again committed.”', 'Ministers have previously said the UK had no plans to secure a free-trade deal with China.

  ["Smart motorways present ongoing risk of death, says coroner","['Coroner concludes lack of hard shoulder on M1 in South Yorkshire contributed to deaths of two men']","['A coroner has called for a review into smart motorways, concluding that the lack of a hard shoulder contributed to the deaths of two men.', 'Sheffield’s coroner, David Urpeth, said smart motorways, which allow motorists to drive on the hard shoulder, present an ongoing risk of future deaths. He said he will be writing to Highways England and the secretary of state for transport to request a review.', 'Urpeth said the primary cause of death of Jason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, on the M1 in South Yorkshire was the careless driving of lorry driver Prezemyslaw Szuba. But recording a conclusion of unlawful killing at Sheffield town hall, he said: “I find, as a finding of fact, it is clear a lack of hard shoulder contributed to this tragedy.', '“I believe that smart motorways, as things currently stand, present an ongoing risk of future deaths.”', 'The men were killed when Szuba’s lorry ploughed into their two vehicles on a stretch of smart motorway, as they stood stationary in the left lane. Szuba, who was jailed for 10 months last October, told the inquest he believes he would have avoided them if there had been a hard shoulder, although he accepted he was driving without paying proper attention.', '“If there had been a hard shoulder on this bit of motorway, the collision would have been avoidable,” he told the inquest. “I would have driven past these two cars as it would be safer and they would have been able to come home safely and I would be able to come back home.”', 'The hearing heard how the tragedy happened on 7 June 2019 after a slight collision between Mercer, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and Murgeanu, who was living in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. The two vehicles stopped in lane one of the four-lane motorway, and both men had got out of their vehicles. They had been stationary for about six minutes when they were hit by Szuba’s lorry, which was travelling at 56mph.', 'Max Brown, the head of road design for Highways England, told the inquest that data showed smart motorways had reduced casualty rates by 18% by one measure and 23% by another. Brown accepted that the removal of the hard shoulder was an added hazard but said this was “offset” by a range of other safety measures.', 'Brown accepted that, on this stretch of the M1, the casualty rate measure had increased since the smart motorway was introduced in March 2017 but stressed there was only one year of data available. An automatic system to detect stationary vehicles is due to be introduced to the M1 in South Yorkshire next month.', 'A government review to revamp smart motorways was launched last March, after safety concerns were raised. At least 38 people have died on stretches of smart motorways in the last six years.', 'Mercer’s wife, Claire, who has become a vocal campaigner against smart motorways, cried in court when the coroner said the lack of a hard shoulder had contributed to her husband’s death.', 'Outside the town hall, she said: “It just reiterates what we’ve been saying for months, just how dangerous these roads are.

  ["Fears language degrees at risk as Erasmus replacement focuses on UK trade agenda ","['Study of modern languages at university has fallen by 38% in 10 years. Will the post-Brexit Turing scheme make things worse? ']","['The dramatic fall in students taking language degrees in the UK could accelerate if the government fails to fund the year abroad in Europe after next year, universities are warning.', 'Students of modern languages have to spend their third year studying or working abroad in order to pass their degree, and academics say this is the main attraction of many courses. Now, with the UK no longer taking part in the EU Erasmus scheme, there are fears for the future of the traditional European year abroad and for many language courses, with 2020 admissions already down 38% on 10 years ago.', 'About 15,000 British students a year, across all subjects, used Erasmus to travel to universities in Europe for three to 12 months during their degree. But the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, said earlier this month that Erasmus did not offer “value for money” for taxpayers.', 'Instead, the government’s replacement programme, the £110m Turing scheme, has a new emphasis on “worldwide” rather than European travel, to countries such as Australia or the US. It is only a one-year commitment, running from September 2021 to August 2022, which leaves a big question mark over placements starting next autumn – when those now in their first year of a language course will be due to set off abroad.', 'Prof Adam Watt, head of modern languages and cultures at the University of Exeter, a member of the Russell group, says: “If I’m an 18-year-old signing up to do a language degree now, I want to know I’ll have a guaranteed place on a year abroad in two years’ time with financial support. But we can’t make that promise. We can’t confirm there is definitely a scheme in place.”', 'Language degrees have taken a battering, with numbers of modern language undergraduates more than halving between 2008-9 and 2017-18, and universities fear the current uncertainty could cause even more serious damage. According to the admissions service, Ucas, 3,830 students were accepted on to modern language degrees in 2020, down 38% from 6,165 in 2010. At least nine modern languages departments have closed in the past decade.', 'Under Erasmus, UK universities formed partnerships with specific universities in Europe and agreed to host each other’s students. Universities are fighting to shore up relationships with European institutions they know their students want to go to, but fear links will be broken because no arrangement is on offer to welcome students back.', 'Claire Gorrara, professor of French at Cardiff University and chair of the University Council of Modern Languages, says exchange links stretching back decades are at risk. “These are trusted partnerships built upon an equitable and reciprocal relationship. It is not clear to us how we continue those long term,” she says.', 'Language academics say less well known institutions may find it particularly difficult to secure places for their students at partner institutions abroad. Some prestigious universities are saying privately they will fund the year in Europe for their language students if the government refuses to do so. But academics say that with declining numbers, less wealthy institutions may drop courses altogether.', 'Watt, an expert in French and comparative literature, says his faculty at Exeter has lots of exchange partnerships with universities across Europe and is racing to work out if there is “any way [we] can carry on an understanding with them”. But, he says, “it is an immensely difficult sell when we can’t offer them a package for their students coming here”.', 'He says that under Erasmus, home students saw a student from abroad in their seminar and realised that the following year they would be in their shoes, sitting in a foreign classroom trying to fit in, which made them think differently about “attitudes to otherness” and the need to be hospitable.', 'Like most academics in his field, Watt is adamant that the year abroad is compulsory for good reason. “Students choosing to study a language course say ‘the year abroad is what attracted me’, and students finishing a language degree say ‘it was what I enjoyed most’,” he says. “It’s about language proficiency, but it’s also about self-confidence, resilience and independence.”', 'However, with funding and partnerships no longer guaranteed, Watt says there are fears in some universities that language degrees may have to be reduced to three years, with only one term abroad. This idea is “very unpopular” with academics, who think it would be much less effective.', '“Students would be strongly encouraged to spend time abroad in their vacations,” he adds. “But of course, you can only spend your vacation staying abroad if you can afford it, so that would have huge implications.”', 'Kate Suffolk, a second-year student of Spanish at the University of Warwick, says working-class students are already disadvantaged, and this would make it worse. “I went to a state school where not many people went to university and I was so proud of myself for getting into a Russell group university. But I soon realised things aren’t equal when you get here. Other students could afford to go to Spain in the summer and improve their language, but I had to do a full-time job at home.”', 'Suffolk, who is due to go on her year abroad in September and has places to study at the universities of Malaga and Valencia, feels strongly that a short stay abroad would not be enough for a language degree. “How would you properly immerse yourself, make friends and get to know the locals and the culture in just a term?”', 'Academics say the new Turing website barely mentions improving language skills. Instead, the scheme is promoting links with countries outside Europe as part of the government’s post-Brexit vision of “global Britain”. Many people fear the government wants students to ditch Spain or Germany in favour of potential trading partners, such as Australia or the US.', 'Dr Sam Coombes, a senior lecturer in French at the University of Edinburgh, is depressed about the implications of the new rhetoric. “There is a fear amongst academics that there might be less takers for modern European language degrees because of Brexit and this general ambience of negative feeling towards the European Union.”', 'It is not only languages academics who are worried about the Turing scheme. Jim Murdoch, professor of public law at the University of Glasgow, says the government is using the scheme to help build links with target countries to advance its own post-Brexit trade agenda. “Turing isn’t primarily about the needs of students,” he says. “Decisions about study destinations should be for academic subject-areas to take, and not for politicians.”', 'On the day the Berlin Wall fell, Murdoch was visiting Germany to set up the law school’s first Erasmus exchange partnership; since then the fact that 60% of Glasgow’s law students do an Erasmus year abroad has become “a real selling point” for prospective students. He says that studying in another European country is more “culturally relevant” than another English-speaking country, as well as more stretching. “When they return, their enhanced self-confidence as learners is quite remarkable,” he says.', 'He adds: “I remind students that Australia is Britain with sunshine. Spending a year in Sydney would still be a valuable experience, but it wouldn’t be as challenging.”', 'Prof Anton Muscatelli, Glasgow’s vice-chancellor, says: “We have relationships with Anglophone countries anyway, so it’s not as if that was missing.”', 'Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has called the UK withdrawal from Erasmus “cultural vandalism”. The Scottish government, along with Wales, tried to stay in the scheme but earlier this week the EU president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that as a “constituent nation” of the UK, Scotland could not take part.', 'Muscatelli says Glasgow University will continue to offer language students a year abroad. “We will just have to do it ourselves if funding is not in place.” ']","Higher education","News","2021-02-19",12,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd830158bdfe64b09169c8f903f211c73710e7a4/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=370ea07e5d86182e67d3abde74e35520","The Turing scheme encourages travel to Australia and the US instead of Europe.

Children who have a right to register as British citizens but may be prevented from doing so because of the high cost or lack of access to legal advice risk losing out on rights and benefits.', 'Thursday’s ruling found that ministers had failed to assess and consider the impact of this fee on children and their rights, pointing out that for some families it was “difficult to see how the fee could be afforded at all”.', 'The Home Office charges £1,012 for a child to register for citizenship. However, the process costs about a third of that, at £372. The Home Office says the profit is used to fund other areas of its work.', 'In December 2019, a high court judge ruled that the fee was unlawful after finding it prevented many children from being registered for citizenship, leaving them feeling “alienated, second-best and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK”.', 'The Home Office appealed against the high court’s ruling that the department had failed in its duty to assess the best interests of children and give primary consideration to these interests in setting the fee.', 'The court of appeal rejected this appeal and the department must now reconsider the fee and ensure that children’s best interests are taken fully into account in doing so.', 'Responding to the judgment, Carol Bohmer, the chair of the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, which brought the case, said she was “delighted” the courts had again held that the “scandalously high” fee was unlawful.', '“We will continue in our mission so no one is in future forced to grow up in the UK suffering the alienation and isolation that is currently the experience of so many young people,” she said.', 'Bohmer, along with the project’s founder, Solange Valdez Symonds, have been campaigning for eight years to reform citizenship fees for children.', 'A Home Office spokesperson said: “Citizenship registration fees are charged as part of a wider fees approach designed to reduce the burden on UK taxpayers.

Unlike London or New York, Manchester does not have any major parks in the city centre.', 'When sit-ins and petitions failed, they brought a judicial review which argued the application should have been blocked because of air pollution.', 'After a high court judge ruled in their favour on Friday, Cameron said: “This is the first time we are aware of a community group beating the council in a legal challenge … It’s time for communities to fight back.”', 'She added: “Now that we have won, we need to turn serious attention to questioning the judgment and competence of the council in using public money to pursue a polluting car park at enormous expense to the taxpayer.”', 'As well as paying its own costs, estimated by Trees Not Cars as £70,000, the council will have to pay Trees Not Cars’ £35,000 legal fees. MCC said it was still collating costs and it would be “inappropriate” to confirm how much of taxpayers money it had spent on the action.', 'Julia Kovaliova, another lead organiser from Trees Not Cars, who has two sons at New Islington free school, said: “I am delighted by the judge’s decision and will be able to sleep easier at night knowing my son who has asthma won’t be exposed to even greater levels of air pollution. Our victory must be a wake-up call for the council, who can’t continue to prioritise car parks and offices over clean air and green space.”', 'Following the judgment on Friday, the council said it had sought leave to appeal.

We’ve been raising this with the Cabinet Office, saying we need both arms of government to be pulling in the same direction.”', 'Members were also reporting big shortages of staff, Lock said, a problem compounded by the fact that many election workers and volunteers tended to be older and that even with the rapid vaccination programme, people were wary.', '“My mum often works at polling stations, she’s had her first jab now, and will have had the second by the election,” Lock said. “But for, basically, the minimum wage, having spent 12 months avoiding everyone, do I want her to risk it? I’m not sure.”', 'Some councils, she said, were asking pandemic volunteers to help with election jobs that do not require training, such as managing queues.', 'There was a particular expectation that counts could be a lot slower, Lock said. By law, council elections need to be declared within four days of the vote, and there was a risk some returning officers – often council chief executives – could be held responsible if this does not happen.', 'Going beyond four days could be a breach of official duty, Lock said, but noted that the law stipulates returning officers have to make every reasonable effort to reach the deadline, which could allow for exceptional circumstances.', 'One source said council chief executives were aware of the issue and were likely to prioritise counts of council votes, as those for mayors and PCCs have a seven-day limit for completion.

Schools are currently open only to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.', 'Ministers and senior policymakers, including permanent secretaries, have attempted to convince Whitty that he needs to make a public statement of support for the policy to reassure parents and teachers about safety, it is understood. But so far he has not provided an endorsement to be included in the media materials to be distributed ahead of Monday’s announcement, sources said.', 'Instead Whitty has offered support described as “lukewarm” and is expected to say it is down to politicians to make the final call on the timing of school reopenings.', 'An education source said they believed the row could be resolved, adding: “No 10 will come up with a formulation of words that Whitty can live with.”', 'A government spokesperson said the claims were “categorically untrue”, adding: “We know schools, parents and pupils need clarity on plans as soon as possible, which is why we have committed to providing two weeks’ notice for them to prepare … Pupils will return from 8 March at the earliest.” A No 10 source said Sage advice on the roadmap would be published “after the event”.', 'While the spread of the virus in schools is still being studied, interim data from the React-1 study this week revealed that while Covid infections had fallen by two-thirds, they were most prevalent among those aged five to 12 and 18 to 24. Researchers suggested this could be due to a significant proportion of primary pupils still in classrooms during lockdown.', 'Like last year’s plan for lifting lockdown, Johnson’s roadmap on Monday is expected to outline the earliest dates when various sectors of the economy could be reopened if coronavirus data allows – with a warning that these could slip if the situation deteriorates. “If we need to move things to the right because of our assessment of the pandemic, then we may have to do that,” said a Downing Street source.', 'The prime minister has repeatedly stressed that schools will be the first things to reopen, with non-essential retail expected to follow, and hospitality after that. Ministers are also eager to build in a pause after children return to the classroom to allow the impact on the spread of the virus to be assessed.', 'However, there is unlikely to be much solid good news for families hoping to book a summer break abroad in the document accompanying the announcement, with Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, still keen to monitor the emergence of variants before lifting curbs on foreign travel.', 'The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will follow the roadmap with a budget on 3 March that is expected to extend business support measures due to run out at the end of the month. Government sources said Sunak is preparing finally to announce a temporary extension of the £20-a-week uplift in universal credit at the budget. Anti-poverty campaigners including the footballer Marcus Rashford have called for the boost to be extended but Sunak is reluctant to make it permanent, with a six-month extension likely.', 'Johnson has been under intense pressure from his party to ensure all schools reopen as soon as possible, with concerns about the issue stretching well beyond the vocal Covid Recovery Group of backbenchers.', 'Three MPs – education select committee chair Robert Halfon, former health minister Steve Brine and Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson – have scheduled a backbench debate on Thursday about the “Covid recovery plan” for schools, which could become a flashpoint for criticism of the prime minister if he is regarded as being too timid about reopening. Some colleagues believe Johnson has become “captured” by his cautious scientific advisers.', 'The roadmap for England will be finalised on Sunday at a meeting of the government’s Covid strategy committee. The full cabinet will then rubberstamp it, probably on Monday morning, before Johnson announces it in the Commons at about 3.30pm. Later he will chair a Downing Street press conference, where he is expected to be flanked by Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance.', 'The pressure on Whitty to wholeheartedly back a “big bang” return for pupils comes as school leaders and unions issued a rare joint statement warning schools should not reopen unless the scientific evidence is unambiguous.', 'The statement warned: “We are increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March in England. This would seem a reckless course of action. It could trigger another spike in Covid infections, prolong the disruption of education, and risk throwing away the hard-won progress made in suppressing the virus over the course of the latest lockdown.”', 'The group said Johnson should “commit to 8 March only if the scientific evidence is absolutely clear that this is safe, and at that point go no further than a phased return of children and young people with sufficient time to assess the impact before moving to the next phase”.', 'Saying school reopening would directly affect 10 million students and staff, nearly a fifth of England’s population, the group said: “This is not a small easing of lockdown restrictions. It is a massive step.”', 'Signatories include the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and National Association of Head Teachers as well as the main teaching unions, and Unite, the GMB and Unison representing school support staff. School governors, sixth form and further education college representatives also signed.', 'A compromise on reopenings may allow primary pupils and secondary school pupils taking exams to return immediately, with other secondary students coming back as testing arrangements allow.', 'Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, has argued for schools to be given the ability to delay the return of year groups in order to carry out the testing required by the government. Those pupils that test negative would then be able to return to the classroom immediately.', 'In Wales the first minister Mark Drakeford announced that primary schools would fully reopen on 15 March following children up to the age of seven returning from Monday. In Scotland children up to the age of seven will also return from Monday, as will some pupils taking exams. Other students are likely to return in mid-March.']","Schools","News","2021-02-19",18.17,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e366fe290da2e1bca1521513d265f0a6c978f5f/0_71_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=442d442c7cc551199eb5e458ed38df62","Chris Whitty, at a No 10 briefing with Boris Johnson, has not publicly endorsed a full reopening of schools on 8 March.

The DWP’s policy placed an unfair burden on vulnerable claimants to prove that they had good cause when they did not attend meetings with DWP officials.', 'DWP officials made two visits to Graham’s home in 2017, and a handful of attempts to communicate with him by phone, but failed to make contact with him before cutting off his benefits, which were his sole source of income.', 'On Thursday a judge ruled that the DWP guidance was lawful and that officials had acted reasonably in Graham’s case. Mr Justice Bourne said neither the law nor DWP policy at the time “mandated any further specific steps to be taken in that situation”.', 'He added: “Despite the tragic circumstances of this case … the claimant falls well short of establishing that the defendant failed to comply with” its duty to make reasonable inquiries into all relevant matters.', 'The family’s lawyer, Tessa Gregory, of the solicitors Leigh Day, said: “We are deeply disappointed by the judgment, which fails to ensure the DWP takes simple steps to protect the lives of vulnerable benefit claimants. We are considering an appeal and Errol’s family will continue to fight for a welfare system that supports rather than endangers lives.”', 'A DWP spokesperson said: “Our sincere condolences remain with Mr Graham’s family. While we welcome this judgment we continue to work to improve the service that we provide to our most vulnerable claimants.”', 'After Graham’s family lodged the claim last July, DWP revised its safeguarding policy, introducing guidance last October requiring staff to widen the scope of inquiries to ensure they checked with police, NHS staff or next of kin before stopping benefits.', 'Mr Justice Bourne said this revision was “in my view a significant improvement to the policy.

The move followed the UK scrapping punitive measures against Boeing in January.', '“The easier it is for Americans to buy a bottle of Macallan, Talisker or Glenfiddich, the more money those producers will have to invest in their businesses, their staff and futures,” said the trade minister Liz Truss. “Today’s agreement shows that both the UK and the US are determined to work together to build back better and take our trading relationship to new heights.”', 'The rapprochement, which was first reported by the Spectator, will also result in tariffs being lifted on a range of goods, including £11m of cashmere, £38m of pork products and £45m of cheese, the DIT said.', '“From scotch whisky distillers to stilton-makers, businesses across the UK will benefit from the US decision today to suspend tariffs in this dispute,” said Boris Johnson.', 'The government said it would continue to seek a “fair settlement” with the White House that removed all remaining punitive tariffs related to the dispute to boost the UK’s aerospace industry.', ' It added that officials on both sides of the Atlantic were working on an ambitious trade deal that could remove £500m of tariffs.', 'Business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry said it hoped the decision would pave the way for more cordial trade relations between the US and the post-Brexit UK.', '“The duties on these goods were harming business and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic,” said director general Tony Danker.', '“This positive step must now lay the foundations for talks at pace to resolve the dispute once and for all. This dispute is lose-lose for all involved at a time when business is suffering from the pandemic, global trade and investment is crucial for economic recovery.”', 'The move puts the UK at odds with the EU, which imposed retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $4bn (£3bn) after the World Trade Organization ruled the US had given illegal state aid to Boeing. The dispute stretches back to 2006, when the US complained that Airbus was receiving subsidies that put Boeing at a competitive disadvantage.', 'Drinks industry figures welcomed an end to tariffs that have proved a drag on sales.', '“Today is a very good day for Scotch and Scotland,” said Ivan Menezes, the chief executive of Diageo, which owns brands including Johnnie Walker and Talisker. “Final resolution of the aerospace dispute, combined with the announcement of a continued freeze on spirits duty in yesterday’s budget, will safeguard thousands of jobs across Scotland and the UK.”', 'The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said tariffs had done “severe damage” to distillers over the 16 months they were in place.', '“Today, everyone in our industry – from small companies to large – is breathing a sigh of relief,” said the SWA chief executive, Karen Betts.', 'But while British drinks firms celebrated, the Distilled Spirits Council of the US said American whiskey distillers were still losing out and called for further action to prevent lost sales.', '“While we welcome the US decision to suspend the retaliatory tariffs on UK distilled spirits for four months, we are greatly disappointed that the UK’s debilitating tariff on American whiskey remains in place,” said a spokesperson.', '“American whiskey exports to the UK, our fourth largest market, have declined by 53%, from $150m to $71m, since the imposition of tariffs.”']","International trade","News","2021-03-04",19.08,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f927089b6f34c78f341827338c5385a79daacd1d/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ce6959eb14031ad9e24cd374400c7bdf","Bottles of The Glenlivet.

', '“It is the first cut to come but there’s many more coming. Now instead of the story being ‘British leadership tackling poverty’, the story is ‘Britain cuts its support and keeps cutting’. It has made people sit up and think.”', 'The UK has announced it will give Yemen about £87m in aid this year, down from £164m in 2020. On Wednesday Boris Johnson blamed the pandemic for the decision to cut spending, saying it was due to the “current straitened circumstances”. He also said: “I think the people of this country will think that we’ve got our priorities right.”', 'At the spending review last year, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the UK would temporarily reduce its aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income. MPs have said the decrease is likely to become permanent, with one MP describing the idea that the government would ever choose to put aid spending back up as being “for the birds”.', 'The 0.7% target is enshrined in law, meaning the government should bring forward a vote on reducing it, but no timetable has been announced.', 'In the budget this week, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office – which has subsumed the Department for International Development – had its departmental budget cut from £12.7bn to £9.9bn.', 'Rebel Tories opposed to the aid cut are not expected to move at the vote on budget resolutions but may seek to amend the finance bill, though sources acknowledged that may be difficult to achieve.', 'Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said many backbenchers would find it difficult to support a cut that would be seen as a retreat from the international stage.', '“With 2021 as such an opportunity to step forward, after a number of years where we have been hesitant and risk-averse and perhaps neglected traditional global leadership, then this was the year where we are president of the G7 and host Cop26, that we can reinvigorate our international resolve, and this does not sit well with cutting back on the aid budget, which has already impacted in supporting Yemen,” he said.', '“There is no doubt that many backbenchers have been focused on domestic matters but we are witnessing a rejuvenation of American determination to play a far more responsible leadership role. And it doesn’t sit well when normally we are absolutely aligned in our political courage to work in tandem with the United States.', '“Yet we are still exporting to the war in Yemen, we have not followed suit from the US [in suspending arm sales to Saudi Arabia]. There is a determination to see Britain move up a couple of gears, particularly coming out of this pandemic, and take a fresh look at the world. I do hope this will resonate with government.”', 'On Thursday Edward Leigh, the former chair of the public accounts committee and an MP usually associated with the Tory party’s right, broke cover to say he would oppose the cuts, saying aid had been “good for our international standing”.', 'Leigh criticised Sunak for not addressing the issue in the budget. “Nothing has been published by ministers regarding the cuts already made. Nor was anything published alongside Rishi Sunak’s budget yesterday or spending review last November,” Leigh wrote in the Evening Standard.', '“The only statements made by [foreign secretary Dominic] Raab to parliament have been about his priority areas.

It was about the #MeToo revelations.”', 'While the momentum that built from 2017 may have forced individual employers to review their policies, how those work in practice depends on the wider cultural context, said Kirsty Thomson, the director of Just Right Scotland, a charitable group of human rights lawyers.', '“What is playing out at the moment with the Salmond inquiry is having a really significant impact. From what we hear, it is having a chilling effect,” said Thomson, who also leads the legal team at the Scottish Women’s Rights Centre, which offers free legal advice to women affected by violence and abuse.', '“Any organisation can say ‘here is a harassment policy’, but someone has to feel confident to use it.”', 'Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC, expressed similar concerns. She said: “My biggest fear is that the way we are discussing this inquiry is not encouraging more women to come forward or stand up to inappropriate behaviour in the future.”', 'Referencing TUC research that found that more than half of women in the UK had experienced sexual harassment at work while four-fifths did not feel able to report it, she said she had heard in particular from younger women in recent days “about the fact that [the Salmond inquiry] is a very triggering experience for them”.', '“As someone whose own activism comes from a formative experience of sexual harassment in the workplace [Foyer was harassed by a senior male manager when she was 17] I certainly can empathise. It’s a very demoralising experience to see the way that this whole matter has been responded to and dealt with by ultimately the people in power. There is a lot of party politicking going on but not a lot of constructive engagement around the fact that women experiencing harassment at work is something that’s endemic across society and has to stop.”', 'The momentum around #MeToo was felt as powerfully in Scotland as it was internationally, said Nicole Busby, professor in human rights, equality and justice at the University of Glasgow. “I saw it speaking to the young women I teach, and that growing recognition that sexual harassment can happen to anyone, it’s very much to do with power and that it is unacceptable. That was a shift from women of my generation who had tolerated it for years.”', 'Busby, who has a particular specialism in harassment tribunal work, said she “cannot stress enough” the importance of retrospective policies such as the policy that the Scottish government formulated in 2017. “Tribunals are usually quite flexible about timelines because they recognise that victims can be traumatised or it is too difficult to take action at the time because of the power dynamics involved.”', 'The public discussion around the inquiry had been unhelpful, said Emma Ritch, the head of Scotland’s feminist policy organisation Engender, accentuating confusion around the difference between criminal law and sexual harassment policy as well as bolstering myths about the likelihood of women making false allegations.', '“There’s a widespread sense from women who talk to us that this has been exceptionally offputting and even re-traumatising to women who have been sexually harassed. One of the things women are most attuned to when making complaints is the prospect of losing control over the process. What has happened with the Salmond inquiry has magnified this: that you could find yourself at the centre of a national scandal, where people feel free to impugn your motives and everything you want to talk about becomes about party politics or the constitution.”', 'For Foyer, the formula for change remains both practical and cultural. She said: “We need robust independent procedures that women can have confidence in. That’s down to every employer to take responsibility for, but we can all do more. As trade unions, we have a role to ensure this issue is being addressed, politicians have a role in how they talk about cases like this and the prominence they give to the root causes, and the media have a role to play as well.”']","Scotland","News","2021-03-05",15.24,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3211c72ac6e2901e761f11c6f41c00a52be9c4/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=b2478d68911bdabde16304430b4c7f2e","Nicola Sturgeon appears at the inquiry into the committee on the Scottish government’s handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond in Edinburgh on Wednesday.

Business leaders broadly welcomed the extension of furlough until September, business rates relief, grants, loans and VAT cuts. But there is concern that the economy will not be back to full strength this autumn. Sunak will be asked if he has gone long enough.', 'Plans to cut the £20 a week universal credit uplift after six months, which risks plunging some households into poverty, will also face heavy scrutiny.', 'The chancellor said he was being “honest” that tax rises would be required in response to a record peacetime deficit of £355bn and persistent higher levels of borrowing.

One MP whose area was excluded from the top tier called the decision “a stitch-up”.', 'Four places are in the uppermost level for funding despite being ranked in the bottom third of English regions by deprivation score, the analysis found. All those areas have Conservative MPs.', 'One area is Richmondshire in North Yorkshire, where the local MP is Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, whose own department is leading work on the fund. This is among the top fifth of most prosperous places in England by the average deprivation score.', 'The analysis will add weight to complaints about “pork barrel politics” within Sunak’s budget on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, areas represented by five cabinet ministers including Sunak himself were placed in tier 1 for the levelling up fund, giving them access to taxpayer funding to help them apply for the £4bn pot.', '“It does really look like the Tories are trying to use taxpayers’ money to shore up their own votes locally, rather than tackle the deeply ingrained inequalities that exist in our country as a result of what they’ve done with 10 years of austerity,” said Steve Reed. “They are spending money to their own political advantage.”', 'The government is yet to make available the qualifying criteria for the levelling up fund, despite Sunak insisting at Wednesday’s press conference that they were “transparently published”.', 'Reed has written to Sunak to ask him to release more details.', 'He said the new fund, for which ministers in Whitehall will decide between competing bids, would be “pitting areas against each other” and replace just a fraction of the resources sucked out of communities by public spending cuts and anaemic economic growth.', '“The money that’s being distributed by the levelling up fund is just a drop in the ocean, compared to what the Conservatives took away over the last 10 years.

It’s because our country is so extremely unequal compared to most of the rest of Europe and other major economies,” he said.', '“Many people in our country are on very, very low incomes or in insecure incomes. And they were afraid to go and get tested in case they were positive and had to self-isolate, and then couldn’t afford to do it.”', 'Reed argued that the government’s method of doling out regeneration funds from Whitehall was part of its broader approach of retaining control, instead of handing power back to communities – something Labour hopes to make a political dividing line at the next general election.', '“It seems to be in the DNA of the Conservatives, they just don’t trust people, they don’t trust communities, they want to control everything from the centre themselves, it’s why they got so much wrong during the pandemic.”', 'He highlighted Jenrick’s controversial proposals for planning reform that would see some areas allocated as “growth” zones, in which the presumption would be in favour of new housing proposals going ahead.', '“It would be entirely in order for a government to say to a local area, ‘we need you to contribute the following number of new homes to a national target that we would need to achieve’, but then allow that locality to choose the best way to achieve that. But instead of that, they’ve taken the voice of local communities away and handed power to their wealthy friends in the development community, who are funding them.”', 'Reed, a former leader of Lambeth council, has represented Croydon North since 2012 and was closely involved in Starmer’s leadership campaign.', 'Asked about recent internal jitters over Starmer’s leadership, he said: “I think we need to give Keir some credit for starting to reconnect the Labour party, not just with the voters who stayed with us, but with the voters that we lost.”']","Spring budget 2021","News","2021-03-04",18.27,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/366680a6cf7ea0c0074a0cfb24b638542da60c11/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=5575ab496a4e47722dd73813ee2b85a5","Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said the Tories were ‘spending money to their own political advantage’.

A source said: “Let’s look at what the chancellor brings forward: if he’s talking about corporation tax going up gradually across the parliament to an OECD average, that’s one thing, but we don’t think there should be tax rises right now where the focus should be supporting business investment and growth.”', 'The stance prompted some unease within the shadow cabinet. One Labour frontbencher said they believed it would change, saying: “Not totally convinced … This is a pretty progressive tax policy that I don’t know if we should be opposing. I’m not sure the position today will be the one we end up with.”', 'But another shadow cabinet source said they thought the expected rise in the budget was “kite flying”. Labour’s line was that tax rises were wrong “right now”, the source said, with any rise in corporation tax likely to come into force later in the parliament.', 'Three other shadow cabinet sources confirmed to the Guardian that they backed the approach to oppose a corporation tax hike next week. One said: “We’ve said for months we will oppose any rise in this budget and it’s consistent with what we’ve been saying that tax rises now will stifle our recovery. The Tories are turning their backs on business and under new leadership there is a new relationship with business.” A source close to Miliband said he backed Starmer’s caution.', 'On Wednesday Starmer pushed the prime minister to act on council tax rises and businesses rates relief, saying: “Now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses.” The exchange was likely aimed to drive a wedge between Boris Johnson and his MPs, many of whom are likely to oppose a rise in corporation tax.', 'The shadow Treasury minister James Murray, appearing on the BBC on Wednesday afternoon, said the party would not back any tax rises. “We’re in the middle of an economic crisis, and this is not the time to do it,” he said. “If you have a country where businesses are closing, where people don’t have money to spend in the economy and where you haven’t got investment going into public services and infrastructure, that is no way to get the country back on its feet.”', 'A number of Labour MPs expressed alarm at the position, including backers of Starmer. Stella Creasy said Labour should always back ways to make the system fairer.', '“A fairer tax system was our ambition before the pandemic, and will be critical to our recovery after as we pick up the pieces,” she said. “We’ve seen several major corporations make substantial profits as a direct consequence of the pandemic – the same companies who will also benefit from the impact of government support getting those who have been hit by redundancy and debt back on their feet.', '“But for that to happen those schemes need to be funded now to stop any more families and small businesses from going under. It’s right that we look at our corporation tax rates and capital gains taxes and ask how and when those with the broadest shoulders can contribute a bit more to the task of rebuilding our nation.”', 'Another former minister said the party should be actively talking up the creation of a windfall tax for businesses that had profited from the pandemic. “Increasing corporation tax does not affect hard-up firms,” they said. “It’s economically illiterate.”', 'Starmer’s comments prompted more explicit criticism from the party’s left. A spokesman for the grassroots group Momentum, which championed the former leader Jeremy Corbyn and has been critical of Starmer, said: “During the pandemic big corporations like Amazon have cashed in while working people struggle to get by. Labour should support both raising corporation tax and a special Covid-19 windfall tax for sectors that have made super profits.”', 'Richard Burgon, the former shadow justice secretary who is secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said: “The question facing all politicians now is: who is going to pay for this crisis? And if we don’t have an answer for that, then we are in a position where Labour doesn’t have an answer to one of the biggest questions facing us. The prime minister rejected my call for a windfall tax.

It will come as a significant financial shock for many, and one that will hit households as furlough ends and big increases in energy prices come into effect.', 'Citizens Advice has also highlighted low awareness of the cut, with frontline advisers reporting “major concerns” and high levels of anxiety among clients over how they will cope without the extra £20 a week.', 'More than 3 million children living in low-income households are likely to be affected by the cut, according to Save the Children, with half of claimants saying they will struggle financially from October. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the cut would push 500,000 people below the poverty line.', 'The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “It is shameful that ahead of the biggest overnight cut to social security in decades, affecting millions of people, the government still has not effectively communicated with those in receipt of universal credit.', '“Inflicting this devastating cut is bad enough but to fail to prepare families for it is adding insult to injury. Perhaps the government are simply too ashamed to own up to their actions. It’s not too late for the prime minister to see sense, cancel his cut and back struggling families.”', 'Backbench Conservative MPs are also concerned about the cut amid nervousness about a growing cost-of-living crisis in southern Tory heartlands and “red wall” areas of the north and Midlands of England.', 'About 6 million people claim universal credit in the UK, the majority of whom began claiming after losing jobs or hours during the pandemic. Many will not have claimed the benefit before April 2020, when the temporary £20 a week uplift was introduced.', 'A survey by the charity Turn2us of 4,000 people between 6 and 13 August, 36% said they were unaware of the £20 cut. Lack of awareness was highest among 18- to 24-year-olds (52%), and in Greater London (43%).', 'Jo Kerr, the director of impact and innovation at Turn2us, said: “We are just weeks away from the biggest cut to our social security system since the second world war, and many people who are going to be affected do not even know it’s coming.” ', 'The Trussell Trust found that 18% of the 2,000 universal credit it polled between 5 and 19 August were unaware of the cut. Garry Lemon, Trussell’s director of policy, said it was alarming the cut was fast approaching and many people were not prepared.', 'Gayle Purves, an adviser at Citizens Advice Newcastle, said: “I advised a woman recently about how she could make ends meet. She has a disabled son who’s turning 18 and that means she will already see a decrease to her benefits. She had no idea about the cut. It was another blow on top of what’s already been an unimaginably difficult year.”', 'Ministers, who confirmed the cut in early July, have not sent out a formal letter to each of the UK’s 6 million universal credit recipients warning of the reduction but are relying instead on a series of messages to claimants’ online journals, backed up with text alerts.', 'A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “We made changes to all statements in July and are currently following up with text messages to alert claimants to check their accounts.

', 'However, its chief executive, Wajid Shafiq, has now admitted it weighs a claimant’s age, which is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010. That means less favourable treatment of someone on the basis of that trait amounts to direct discrimination and may be illegal.', 'Xantura spoke to the Guardian after civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch obtained a cache of documents under the Freedom of Information Act providing a glimpse into how Xantura’s system has operated.', 'It automatically recommends riskier housing and council tax benefit claimants for tougher checks which can lead to delayed decisions. It also accelerates applications for supposedly low-risk applicants.', 'Xantura insists its use of age helps reduce fraud and error, speeds up the majority of applications and does not breach the Equality Act, citing a legal exception allowing financial services providers to account for age. But campaigners are calling for greater scrutiny.', 'The documents released to BBW showed Xantura has processed data about where people live – including the ethnic mix of their neighbourhood – their sex and family situation.', 'Sex and race are protected characteristics, but Shafiq said “apart from age it doesn’t use any other of the protected characteristics”. He said information about neighbourhoods and sex were only used to check if the system was operating in a biased way after decisions had been taken. ', 'He declined to confirm what other personal information is fed into the algorithm, saying it could allow claimants to game the system, but said information provided by claimants could be used in the prevention of fraud and error.', 'Asked whether the algorithm predicts that older or younger people are more likely to commit fraud or error, he replied: “[It is] not that simple. It is a multi-variate model, so various combinations of risk factors need to exist to generate fraud or claims that are in error.”', 'He had previously said: “No protected characteristics are used in the RBV model.”', 'Xantura is one of several companies helping automate the benefits system, but the workings of “welfare robots” have been shrouded in secrecy. Claimants are not told their applications are being subject to algorithmic decision-making and there is rising concern at the impact. ', 'According to documents released to BBW, Xantura said in a confidential 2012 “model overview” that variables “deemed to be statistically significant” include the type of area a person lives in, as defined in broad categories which in part reflect ethnic make-up. At the time these Office for National Statistics-defined groups included “ethnicity central” to describe locations which typically feature more non-white people than the UK average “especially people of mixed ethnicity or who are black”.', 'A 2017 RBV “user guide” released by Salford city council written by Xantura’s business partner Northgate listed 66 pieces of “specific data requested by Xantura” to calculate a risk score including sex, age and disability. ', 'Shafiq said there was “an error in the way the documents were written” and not all these factors were used to determine the risk posed by a claimant.', '“It’s a difference between the RBV system and the RBV model and that distinction needs to be made more clearly in those documents. There has been a miscommunication.”', 'Some of Xantura’s local authority clients have stated in public documents that they do not believe the system has an “equalities impact” because it doesn’t use protected characteristics, such as age, sex, race and disability. Xantura provides client councils with a draft template to put RBV policies in place, including performance reporting and sign off.', '“In our experience our clients use our draft policies in the development of their own policies,” Shafiq said.', '“There is a duty to prevent fraud and error,” he said. “If local authorities decide we shouldn’t be using age in the modelling process we can take it out.”', 'Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at BBW, said: “Dozens of councils have waived through RBV policies without considering the real risk of discrimination the algorithms pose and nobody has a clue the damage these algorithms could do because bias and disproportionality are not monitored.”', 'Andy Mitchell, a benefit claimant who assists others with applications, said: “All the groups that are usually targeted are hit again by these algorithms – the poorest in society, the people that have no voice.”', 'Robin Allen QC, a discrimination lawyer who runs the AI Law Consultancy, said: “Using the protected characteristic of age to suggest who might be cheating the benefits system is unlikely to be lawful. Age is not a good proxy for honesty and should not normally be used as such. ”', 'Shafiq defended the system, saying: “It’s entirely appropriate that we use age and it’s entirely appropriate that we use other fields too because all the data that [a claimant] supplied can be used for the prevention of fraud and error.

The DWP argues the rule prevents so-called “double provision” – the taxpayer paying twice for the same thing.', 'Cameron has had a neurological condition since birth that has left him unable to speak or walk and requiring 24-hour care. He also has epilepsy, muscle disorders, and suffers from frequent chest infections.', 'He was taken to hospital in Newcastle, 60 miles from his Carlisle home, in late December, suffering from septic shock. He spent the next six months receiving treatment in a high dependency unit, initially in the paediatric section of the hospital and subsequently on the adult ward.', 'His mother and father were in daily attendance and, as his full-time carers, were on call at the request of NHS staff. When his condition stabilised they took him on daily trips outdoors, and provided essential care such as suctioning his chest, looking after his stoma bag, and checking for hard-to-detect signs of distress and pain.', '“Cameron has been hospitalised many times during his life and we have always stayed by his bedside day and night because he needs us to communicate for him and to help the medical staff identify and treat his complicated seizures. He can deteriorate very quickly unless you know what to look for,” said Clulow.', 'However, Cameron’s £151-a-week PIP payment – and his mother’s £67-a-week carer’s allowance – were stopped in May, several weeks after Clulow wrote to the DWP in March explaining the change in Cameron’s circumstances. They were also told they must repay hundreds of pounds in benefits dating back to the end of January.', '“To suddenly be hit with the realisation that I was going to have to meet considerable extra costs and then find that I would have to do this on even less money caused me massive worry and stress when my only focus should have been on Cameron and his younger brother at home,” she said.', 'Carolin Ott, a solicitor with Leigh Day, which is acting on behalf of Cameron, said: “Cameron’s care needs are not and cannot be met by the NHS alone without the input of known carers, and those care needs do not suddenly cease to exist after Cameron has spent 28 days in hospital.', '“Our client is arguing that the rule requiring suspension of PIP discriminates between disabled adults who require hospitalisation for more than 28 days, whose care needs cannot be met other than with the input of a known carer, as compared to those who are hospitalised for less than 28 days.”', 'A complicating factor has been Cameron’s age – even though he was 19 he was regarded as still a child by the education system because he attended a special school and therefore his mother received child benefit. Children are not subject to the 28-day hospital rule, yet DWP regulations treat him as an adult.', 'Until 2015, children were subject to a regulation that suspended their disability benefits after they had stayed more than 84 days in hospital. This was overturned after the supreme court ruled it was “grossly unfair” and in breach of human rights.', 'The case was brought by the family of severely disabled five-year-old Cameron Mathieson, whose benefits were withdrawn after 12 weeks of what turned out to be a two-year stay in hospital.

People had felt under pressure to accept the offer, sometimes worth thousands of pounds a year less than they were entitled to, were not told about their appeal rights, or given the opportunity to discuss the offer with representatives.', 'K had made a claim for the personal independence payment benefit in 2017 but was refused. She applied again in 2019 and was awarded only a small amount. She appealed against the decision after her GP advised her that her serious mobility problems meant she was entitled to the highest levels of benefit.', 'After the appeal process started, she was called by the DWP, without warning, from a “withheld” number and told she had an hour to accept a deal that was higher than her award but less than she was entitled to. She was told “tribunals are not very nice to go to” and asked if she wanted to risk losing all her benefit.', 'K, who has fibromyalgia and epilepsy, and needs help with daily washing, accepted the offer but said afterwards she felt pressured into making the decision. She said she was “haunted” by her choice and decided to challenge the DWP after seeing press reports exposing the practice.', 'She said: “I wasn’t given the time I needed to speak to my mum or seek any advice. They didn’t give me the information that I needed to work out if it was what I was entitled to, and they didn’t tell me I could accept the offer and still appeal the decision if I wanted.”', 'She added: “It feels as though the DWP has been picking on extremely vulnerable people and using the fear of going to a tribunal or losing an award to pressure people into accepting less than they should be getting.”', 'K was offered a deal that amounted to £1,500 a year less than she would have been entitled to if she had successfully pursued the tribunal.', 'Disability benefit decisions are notoriously unreliable, and the process of appealing against them is long and stressful. The vast majority of benefit appeals cases that reach tribunal find in favour of the claimants.', 'Sara Lomri, K’s solicitor at the Public Law Project, said: “Unfortunately, a practice has developed over the last few years at the DWP whereby benefits decision-makers have been putting pressure on eligible disabled benefits claimants to accept less than their statutory entitlement. Most people would be outraged if they knew that a friend or vulnerable relative was treated this way.', '“Judicial review is always a last resort, and this case shows why there must be an accessible legal route for people to hold public authorities to account. The law is there for us all to follow, and when the state makes a mistake, acts unlawfully, and will not change itself, there must be a way to correct it.”', 'The Law for Life charity, which collected many of the cases, was also involved in the case.', 'The DWP, which was ordered to pay 90% of the costs of the case, has agreed to issue guidance to officials making it clear they should not make so-called “partial lapse” awards similar to that made to K. Staff involved in these cases will be given mandatory retraining.', 'A DWP spokesperson said: “Our overarching aim is that claimants are paid the correct amount of benefit at the earliest opportunity.', ' “We contact people if we can revise a decision and increase their benefits award as a result of new evidence becoming available after their appeal was lodged – and they always have the option to continue with their appeal or challenge a revised decision.', ' “We have addressed PLP’s concerns by improving our guidance on telephone calls so options and appeal rights are always clearly set out, as well as stopping making contact when a tribunal is imminent, and we are pleased they have withdrawn their case.”']","Benefits","News","2021-07-14",12,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf0bbc39a45bdbdcb01dc2faede66421dd355ee4/0_65_1852_1111/master/1852.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=740630f5d0939cb5fe9f18394b9de21c","The Department for Works and Pensions backed down over the practice the day before a judicial review challenge at the high court.

More than four-fifths of those capped in February were families with children, half of them with children under the age of five. Single parents headed 59% of capped households.', 'The main driver of increased capping over the last quarter was likely to be families who had started to claim universal credit at the beginning of the pandemic reaching the end of a nine-month “grace period” of protection from the cap from December onwards.', 'The latest rise in families having payments capped follows a doubling at the start of the pandemic when the £20-a-week universal credit uplift to help poorer households cope with the extra costs of Covid pushed many families over the cap threshold, leaving them even worse off than they were before the crisis.', 'Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Especially in areas with high rents, capped families are losing large amounts of social security support and that is disastrous for the children concerned. The government must abolish the benefit cap to prevent more children from being damaged by impoverishment.”', 'The cap – a limit on the total amount of benefit people can claim – was introduced in 2013 to provide an “incentive” for jobless claimants to find work. Ministers have since made it even less generous, despite evidence – including from the DWP’s own research – that capped claimants were less likely to find work.', 'The cap restricts jobless universal credit or housing benefit couple claimants to household benefit payments totalling £20,000 a year (£385 a week) outside London and £23,000 (£442 a week) in the capital. These limits have remained unchanged since 2016.', 'A DWP spokesperson said: “The benefit cap, up to the equivalent salary of £28,000 in London, ensures fairness for hard-working taxpaying households and a strong work incentive, while also providing a much needed safety net of support.

In the same period, 280 people died within six months of having had their disability benefit applications rejected, despite them claiming under rules specifically designed to get fast-track support to terminally ill people.', 'The charities said the government had to scrap the restrictive “six-month rule” under which people must prove they have six months or less to live to access fast-track benefits support.', 'The charities said data, collected between April 2018 and October 2019, raised “serious concerns” about the DWP’s ability to recognise when a claimant was approaching the end of life. They said they wanted to see rapid access to benefits kicking in as soon as terminal illness medical diagnoses were made.', 'In July 2019 Amber Rudd, as the UK work and pensions secretary, announced a “fresh and honest” DWP evaluation of the way the benefits system supported terminally ill patients. The charities say that although the review she commissioned had been completed the findings were “being withheld”.', 'Mark Jackson, policy and public affairs manager at Marie Curie, said: “The current law plunges dying people into uncertainty – they know they are dying but because they do not know how long they have left they can’t access financial support quickly.”', 'Helena Reynolds, 60, from Essex was visited by a DWP assessor in her home when she was moved from one benefit, disability living allowance (DLA), to its replacement, personal independence payment. Despite being terminally ill, and with a doctor’s letter to prove it, she had her benefits cut.', 'She said: “The assessor didn’t recognise that I was terminally ill.

I have Crohn’s disease, osteoporosis, brittle bone disease and intestinal failure.', '“I have been receiving end-of-life support from a hospice but had to cancel my other care after the review as I couldn’t afford to pay for it. I was forced to appeal and only then did I receive a higher rate.', '“Terminally ill people shouldn’t be judged by these assessors who aren’t medically trained. My doctors should be listened to and trusted – they’re not though, and people like me suffer as a result.”', 'A government spokesperson said: “Terminal illness is devastating, and our priority is dealing with people’s claims quickly and compassionately, which we’ve continued to do throughout the pandemic.', '“We are grateful to charities and stakeholders who have worked with us, including Marie Curie, for their invaluable insight and are working across government on proposals including changing the six-month rule and raising awareness of the support available.”', ' This article was amended on 10 June 2021. An earlier version said more than 100 terminally ill people a month were being rejected for benefits despite having less than six months to live. It is not known if these claimants were terminally ill, only that they died within six months of being rejected for disability benefits. This has been clarified. However, it is known that a further 15 people a month were dying within six months of being rejected for disability benefits claimed under fast-track rules specifically for terminally ill people.

Thousands of babies and toddlers similarly denied access to the scheme will now be able to benefit from it.', ' Healthy Start aims to reduce child poverty and health inequalities by providing free vitamins, dietary advice and weekly vouchers to buy nutritious food or infant formula to low-income families with pregnant women and children up to the age of four. It is intended to benefit those in the “greatest need”.', 'However, the eligibility criteria excluded some of the UK’s poorest children from migrant backgrounds because their families are unable to claim mainstream benefits, which is the trigger for entitlement to this scheme. As a consequence, babies and toddlers from the most financially deprived households were going without the food and vitamins needed for a healthy start in life.', 'Olivia Halse of MG & Co Solicitors, who was involved in the case, said: “This is a great outcome for some of the most disadvantaged children in our society who should have never been excluded from accessing this essential support in the first place. We hope this extension will go some way toward tackling health inequalities and child food poverty in the UK and help provide these children with a healthy start in life.”', 'The claim was brought by the one-year-old identified only as child “A”, a British citizen, and her mother. Her mother has the right to live and work in the UK but was not allowed to claim welfare benefits including from the Healthy Start scheme. The household income is almost 40% less than that of families claiming welfare benefits.', 'Halse brought a judicial review against the health secretary, Matt Hancock, arguing that the policy was indirectly discriminatory against children and mothers from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, breached their human rights and was inconsistent with the intended purpose of the scheme.', 'The case was due to be heard in the high court at the end of last month. However, Hancock conceded, agreeing to extend the eligibility criteria and to hold a consultation. As a result, all British children under the age of four, whose parents would meet the financial criteria to claim welfare benefits but are unable to do so as a result of their immigration status, will now be entitled to support provided under the Healthy Start scheme. The regulations will be amended and a consultation reviewing the broadening of the scheme will take place later this year.', 'In the meantime, Hancock has agreed to implement a process by which families in this position will be able to access support by way of an ex gratia benefit.', 'A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government is committed to making sure every child gets the best possible start in life. Our Healthy Start Scheme supports pregnant women and families on lower incomes to make healthier food choices and in April we increased the value of Healthy Start vouchers from £3.10 to £4.25 to help more families adopt a healthy diet.', '“The No Recourse to Public Funds policy spans across government and appropriate consultation is needed prior to legislative changes.

Advances fraud, often the result of identity theft, amounted to £150m in 2019-20. The DWP said this form of fraud was now back to pre-Covid levels.', 'However, because of DWP underpayments claimants missed out as a whole on £2.5bn of entitlements.

One told the Sunday Times that the prime minister had entered “the killing zone” this week, while another told the Mail on Sunday that she should “bring her own noose” if she went to the 1922 Committee meeting.', 'Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said: “Language like this debases politics. Get a grip, Tories.”', 'Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said there was a real lack of confidence that May could bring back “anything by way of a good deal” because the government was so divided. He said Tory infighting seemed “to have gone to another level”.', 'There are 315 Conservative MPs.

  ["Finding Freedom: 10 things we learned from Harry and Meghan's book","['Biography reveals extent of Buckingham palace’s hostility towards Duchess of Sussex']","['A new book by the royal reporters Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie chronicles what the authors’ claim has been a deepening rift between Prince Harry, his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Buckingham Palace – which ultimately led to the couple’s decision to take a step back from public life. The biography has been providing headlines in UK newspapers in recent days after being serialised in the Times and the Sunday Times. So, what have we learned from Finding Freedom?', 'According to the book, one of the main drivers behind the couple’s decision was the way they felt Meghan was treated by members of the royal family. One of the authors has said the fact Meghan is a mixed-race American was “going to ruffle some feathers” within Buckingham Palace.', 'One senior royal is said to have referred to Meghan as “Harry’s showgirl”, while another allegedly said: “She comes with a lot of baggage.”', 'The couple were also reportedly unhappy with the way Meghan was treated by Buckingham Palace staff. “There’s just something about her I don’t trust,” a senior courtier is reported to have said, while an unnamed staffer is quoted as having referred to her as the palace’s “squeaky third wheel”. The authors say the couple grew to trust only a handful of people.', 'The two couples, William and his wife, Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Harry and Meghan, were barely even on speaking terms by this March, according to the authors. They hardly spoke to each other during an engagement at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey that month, despite not having seen each other since January.', 'The authors claim that Harry was upset by his brother’s advice to “take as much time as you need to get to know this girl” early in their relationship, which he took to be “snobbish” and “condescending”.', 'The authors add: “[William] just wanted to make sure that Harry wasn’t blindsided by lust” in his haste to get married.', 'The authors suggest reports of a feud between the two women were always wide off the mark. Rather, they say, the pair simply had little in common. The book claims Meghan perceived a lack of support from Kate, who, in turn, would try to make contact while not worrying too much if there was no response.', 'Perhaps an unsurprising revelation on its own terms – the couple had their own website and sought to register “Sussex Royal” as a global trademark – but the book describes the pair’s surprise at courtiers’ treatment of them as they sought greater autonomy than Buckingham Palace was willing to grant.', '“As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghan’s difficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the royal family,” the book reveals.', 'Prior to “Megxit”, the couple were on such bad terms with other members of the royal family that the couple believed them to be leaking stories about them to the press, the authors claim.', 'According to the book, the monarch was “devastated” by the announcement on the couple’s private website of their plans to take a step back. It claims she was put in an awkward position by the plan for a half-in, half-out royal status, which it was felt had been presented as a fait accompli, although it was nothing of the sort.', 'According to the book, it was known within the palace walls that Harry and Meghan wanted changes to their royal status and had sought discussions with the Queen prior to a six-week trip to Canada at the end of last year.', 'It says they made the final decision while in Canada and again sought a meeting with Harry’s grandmother, but were told she would not be available until the end of January 2020. The announcement, the authors claim, came on 8 January because the couple got wind that a story was due to break in the UK press.', '“The courtiers blame Meghan, and some family do,” the authors wrote. She, on the other hand, felt she had sacrificed a lot for the royals. “As Meghan tearfully told a friend in March: ‘I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad.’”', 'The Sussexes have distanced themselves from the book, with a spokesman saying they were not interviewed and did not contribute to it.

Meghan was disappointed she and Kate had not bonded over their shared position but she “didn’t lose sleep” over it, according to the book.', 'Rather, the authors claim, the alleged rift between the two couples was due to a growing coolness between Harry and William.

Scobie told the Times Meghan had tried to make eye contact with Kate at the service, but had been barely acknowledged. “To purposefully snub your sister-in-law … I don’t think it left a great taste in the couple’s mouths.”', 'Harry and Meghan’s decision to cut free grew out of Harry’s belief they were unprotected by the institutions around the monarchy and derided by the old guard for being too sensitive and outspoken, the book claims.', 'This apparently led to their decision to move to Windsor. “He wanted to get away from the goldfish bowl that was Kensington Palace,” the authors said. It is also claimed they believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press.', 'Once they decamped to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, thus splitting from the Cambridges at Kensington Palace, it was apparently “a big disappointment” to them to be told they must operate under Buckingham Palace’s umbrella. The authors wrote: “As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghan’s difficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the royal family.”', 'Having spent Christmas in Canada away from palace pressure, and formulated plans to move there, they were unable to immediately see the Queen to discuss their plans. Believing they were being blocked from seeing the monarch, they even considered breaking protocol by springing a surprise visit by driving straight to see her from the airport terminal after landing back in the UK, it was claimed.', 'When they made their “Megxit” announcement on a new website, Sussexroyal.com, aides including the Queen’s private secretary were said to be furious, and the Queen and Prince Philip apparently devastated.', 'Neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace have commented.', ' This article was amended on 27 July 2020 to clarify details about the relationship between Kate and Meghan as related in the book, specifically that it was the latter who was not losing sleep over it, not the former as stated in an earlier version.']","Monarchy","News","2020-07-26",12,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1683d839e4657a3ad7e198ab66b64ba64c53314c/501_36_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=31ba408a227481291d7cddfc1b3b06b8","The royal couples were said to be barely speaking by the time of the Commonwealth Day service in March.

I couldn’t believe it.”', 'At the time the designer was an award-winning star of the BBC’s graphics department who helped mastermind the graphics for the BBC’s 1992 election night coverage while still in his 20s.

His work won him a prestigious Royal Television Society award, alongside a personal note of praise from then-BBC News boss Tony Hall, who would later become the corporation’s director general.', 'He had just quit the corporation to start his own freelance television graphics business when a call came from Bashir requesting an urgent mock-up of a bank statement.', '“I came home and there was a phone call saying: ‘Hey, can you do something for me?’,” said Wiessler, who followed the journalist’s instructions and delivered the graphics after a frantic’s night work, unaware of how it would be used or its significance.', 'It is claimed Bashir used the fake documents to convince Earl Spencer that the media were paying associates of the family for information on Diana. By the time the allegations had surfaced the interview had already been a global ratings success for the BBC and turned Bashir into a household name.', 'According to recently released documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC then launched an internal inquiry led by Hall, which concluded Bashir “wasn’t thinking” when he commissioned the graphic but was ultimately an “honest and honourable man”.', 'What had not been made public until this year is that the same inquiry, presented to the BBC board, concluded that Wiessler should never work for the corporation, in part because he had spoken to the media about the incident.', 'Wiessler said he was shocked to read the findings: “I didn’t find this out until three months ago … The only outcome of that board meeting was that Martin was naughty but an honest man – and Matt cannot work for the BBC again.”', 'He said he was never formally told of his ban but his new company’s work with the BBC dried up, severely damaging a young business that specialised in producing graphics for current affairs television programmes in the UK: “Everyone was briefed, a lot of graphic designers said: ‘Boys, we can’t talk to you, word is out, you’ve been naughty’ … It just filtered through the organisation.”', 'After a few years he drifted out of the media industry and is now co-owner of a Devon bicycle design business.

We associate a ‘forger’ with someone that’s in prison.”', 'The BBC has pledged to hold a fresh inquiry into the events that led to the interview but Wiessler said he just wanted someone to say sorry: “I want a pretty comprehensive apology and I want the people who were a part of this process to explain themselves to an independent commissioner.”', '“I didn’t have any intent to do anything with that document … Has that damaged my life?

We are in the process of commissioning a robust and independent investigation.”', 'The BBC has said Bashir is currently unable to answer questions as he is currently signed off work by his doctors. It said the journalist, currently employed as the BBC’s religion editor, is recovering from quadruple heart bypass surgery in addition to having “significant complications” after contracting Covid-19 earlier in the year.', 'The announcement follows weeks of campaigning by Diana’s brother Earl Spencer, who claims Bashir repeatedly deceived him in order to gain access to the royal as her marriage to Prince Charles collapsed. The subsequent interview made headlines around the world and turbo-charged Bashir’s career, as he won praise for a major journalistic scoop.', 'The BBC’s announcement comes as ITV prepares to air an interview with Matt Wiessler, a graphic designer who was asked by Bashir to mock-up the fake bank statements that allegedly helped the journalist secure his career-defining interview.', 'The false documents gave the impression that associates of the royal family were selling stories to newspapers, with Spencer saying this and other deceptions were the reason he introduced Bashir – then a relatively obscure Panorama journalist – to his sister.', 'The issue was investigated at the time, with the BBC’s former news chief Tony Hall clearing Bashir of wrongdoing in 1996, while telling the corporation’s board that the graphic designer who followed Bashir’s orders “will not work for the BBC again”.', 'Wiessler subsequently left the media and now works for bicycle design company in Devon. At the same time Bashir went on to have a successful journalistic career around the world, while Hall returned to the BBC as director general.', 'The graphic designer told the ITV documentary The Diana Interview: Revenge Of A Princess that he had been made to be the “fall guy” for Bashir’s actions: “I’m this guy that’s remembered for forging the document and I want to clear my name. I got a phone call from Martin Bashir and he wanted me to do a favour for him and it was really urgent and really important.', '“Martin asked me to make up a couple of bank statements about people being paid to do surveillance that he needed the following day.

Because, why would this happen? Why would someone break in? And I wasn’t getting any clear answers from anyone. I’d never had a break-in before in my life. And I just thought someone was sending me a message or something.”', 'Wiessler also recalled meeting Bashir when the story of the faked bank statements was first reported 25 years: “… all he could think of doing, was saying to me, ‘Whatever you do, don’t go to the media. Carry on talking to us. We’re not doing anything… We didn’t do anything wrong. You’ve to trust us on this.’ I walked out of that restaurant, knowing that I had to go to the media. Because Martin was just simply in this instance, covering for himself.”', 'He said the incident had shaken his trust in the corporation: “In almost a naive way, I thought when you worked for the BBC, you were working for the greater good of everything. After this episode, almost all of that fell away, and I thought what it is really about is senior management and senior producers and presenters protecting themselves at all costs.', '“I quite clearly felt that I was the one that was going to be the fall guy in this story.

The BBC hailed it the scoop of a generation.', 'Conducted during the very public War of the Wales’ – three years after the couple had separated – it blew the lid off their marriage and substantiated many press rumours.', 'In it Diana damned Charles by questioning his suitability to be king. Famously referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, she said: “Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.” She admitted her own infidelity with army captain James Hewitt and revealed she would never be queen.', 'She spoke candidly of her postnatal depression, of self-harming, of her bulimia, and admitted she allowed friends to collaborate with the author Andrew Morton on his bombshell biography of her.', 'The fallout was deeply damaging. It completely compromised her relationship with the royal family, who knew nothing of the interview in advance, leaving her isolated from any palace support.', 'This month marks the 25th anniversary of the interview. At the time there were questions over how Martin Bashir, then a young, relatively unknown television reporter, had managed to land such a prize.', 'In the immediate aftermath, a BBC graphics designer said Bashir had asked him to produce fake bank statements that, it was then alleged, could have been used to coerce Diana into conducting the interview. The BBC launched an internal investigation, headed by Tony Hall, a future director general of the BBC.', 'The 1996 inquiry cleared Bashir of any misconduct. It found that while Bashir had commissioned the documents, he had discarded them when he was unable to substantiate the information they contained.', 'A BBC spokesman at the time said: “It wasn’t a very good idea to have these documents made, and Mr Bashir accepts that. But we have confirmed that in no way were the documents used to gain the interview with Princess Diana.”', 'The BBC also said that in a handwritten note – subsequently lost – Diana confirmed she did not see the “mocked-up” documents.', 'Earl Spencer, Diana’s brother, is on the warpath and is demanding a new BBC investigation.

Davie declined to open a further investigation.', 'But in an explosive intervention, Spencer’s reply to Davie, leaked to the Daily Mail, accuses the BBC of a “piecemeal apology”, of “yellow journalism” , of a “whitewash” and of not accepting “the full gravity of the situation”.', 'Spencer claims he was shown other forged documents that wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister.', 'His reply states: “If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister.

It’s just isn’t done any more, nobody lets their kids do that,” said Fisher, a community architect. “I had some conversations and it seemed my generation had all experienced that kind of play from seven or eight years old and yet it had virtually disappeared now.”', 'Experts have raised concerns about the growing “scholarisation of childhood” and Fisher’s experience is not uncommon, with the British Children’s Play Survey published this week finding children typically are not are allowed to play outside on their own until two years older than their parents’ generation were. “Some people think it’s a rural and urban thing, but I grew up in south-east Birmingham and had that experience,” said Fisher. “It just got me thinking, is there any way of enabling this again?”', 'Soon after, with the help of her friend and former primary school teacher, Lisa Walke, they set up Roam, a first of its kind charity running sessions to help support parents and children with safe, unsupervised play outside.', 'At each session, families come together at a park in Birmingham and up to 15 children, all under-12s, are given some ground rules – they must stay in groups of at least three at all times, for instance – before being allowed to roam alone for up to two hours.', 'Volunteers keep tabs on them and count numbers on a regular basis, but do not interfere. They also run sessions with more supervision for younger children and those with additional needs. “A lot of our families have said they are much more comfortable [with unsupervised play] now and they’ve seen that their children’s capabilities are much better than they thought,” said Fisher.', 'They also found that when the adults step back, the older children step up and take more responsibility, helping to form strong bonds between children of different ages.', '“The older children learn to foster that role of protector and the younger children learn off them in a very natural way,” said Notzarina Howell-Jones, who has been bringing eight-year-old Skyla and six-year-old Ioan to Roam sessions for a couple of years. “They have both just absolutely loved the roaming, and my daughter in particular relishes the independence.', '“It was a really unique opportunity for them get away from me, and my opinions on what they were doing, and my reminders about being careful, all of the things I think a lot of modern parents fall into the habit of doing.”', 'When Roam surveyed parents, it found that although road danger and safety fears were a key reason behind why many did not let their children play alone, so too was fear of judgment.', '“The overriding reason was that not many children do it, and parents felt their child would stand out and their parenting would be judged,” said Fisher. “My biggest fear at the pilot sessions was that a member of the public might approach the children and say: ‘You’re way too young to be your own.’”', 'But Fisher said she had noticed a growing public consciousness around the need for independent play, and demand for its services is skyrocketing – its last set of sessions were fully booked in eight minutes.', '“I definitely found their first sessions hard, that sense of letting go was difficult,” said Howell-Jones. “But the more normal it becomes for children to play like this, the safer communities become, because children learn to look out for one another in a way that they don’t if parents are helicoptering around them.”']","Children","News","2021-04-25",9.47,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/119cd1c2b5033881da5f5267cffd7adebee560d4/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8b8d708965a0f9ac6468e8c8e0fe4125","Children playing on a vine swing.

  ["Call for more play time amid ‘schoolification’ of UK childhood","['Experts urge government to take more holistic approach to children’s lives and wellbeing in light of Covid']","['Education experts and child psychologists have raised the alarm about the creeping “scholarisation of childhood”, as evidence grows that free play both at school and at home is being eroded in favour of academic, sporting and cultural activities.', 'Experts are concerned that children in the UK are losing unstructured play time during the school day, with shorter lunch breaks filled with supervised educational activities. Once school has finished, homework and extracurricular pursuits are further eating into free time.', 'They are calling on the government to take advantage of the pause created by the pandemic to think afresh about childhood beyond the narrow lens of academic attainment and bring a halt to the increasing “schoolification” of young lives.', '“Huge numbers of children have had a miserable year,” said Tim Gill, author and advocate for children’s play. “I hope one of the things the pandemic might prompt is a step back to allow a holistic look at children’s lives and wellbeing.”', 'This week the British Children’s Play survey showed today’s youngsters are having to wait longer before they are allowed to play outside on their own – they are typically 11, while their parents were two years younger – and often engage in less adventurous play than previous generations.', 'Meanwhile, debate continues to rage about measures to support children’s recovery following the pandemic disruption. While the government’s focus is on academic catchup, extended school days and shorter holidays, child psychologists have called for a summer of play to protect children’s mental health.', '“The loss of play is incredibly serious,” warned Dr Naomi Lott, an expert on the right to play at University of Nottingham. “It has such wide-ranging impacts on children. But because play is viewed as frivolous we forget all the benefits, which have a long-term effect on children and society as a whole.”', 'Research by the UCL Institute of Education has shown that school breaktimes have been curtailed over the years and are as much as an hour shorter than they were two decades ago, often filled with a range of organised activities further limiting free play.', 'Hackney New school, a secondary in east London, recently attracted national interest after it introduced chess clubs, poetry recitals and quizzes during the lunch break to reduce bullying. “It’s long been my belief that we could be doing more for pupils while they are on their breaks,” headteacher Charlotte Whelan told the BBC. “So often you see them aimlessly wandering the playground. We want every second at school to count.”', 'Former headteacher and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said school breaktimes had decreased as a performance culture took over in schools and he called for a better balance. “I’m not criticising the performance culture, but these are young people growing up, preparing for the big wide world. They need to learn how to mix with each other and become more mature by mixing.”', 'Experts say other examples of the “schoolification of childhood” include: breakfast and after-school clubs, which help working parents but extend the school day into once free time; the growing importance of homework even in primary schools; the pressure to get very young children “school-ready”; and the advent of the “back-seat generation” who are picked up from school and ferried to activities.“Children’s breaktimes at school have decreased, the age they are allowed without supervision has increased and the focus after a year of having their social play restricted is on ‘academic catchup’,” said Helen Dodd, a professor of child psychology at the University of Reading.', '“This scholarisation of childhood, and the increase in time children spend in adult-led activities, decreases children’s time spent playing, removes opportunities for independence and denies them the simple joys and freedoms of childhood.', '“Brian Sutton-Smith famously said that the opposite of play is depression and yet, in the face of rising rates of mental health problems, we continue to neglect the value of play.”', 'According to senior educational psychologist Dr Melernie Meheux: “Reduced opportunities for play and a heavy focus on structured/formal learning both at home and at school place unnecessary pressure on children and families.', '“Parents can feel pressure for their children to perform and achieve, as can children, which in the long term can affect children’s sense of self, confidence and willingness to take risks.”', 'One mother, whose nine-year-old has a packed extra-curricular schedule of piano, choir, football, ballet, modern dance and swimming, described waking up in the middle of the night worried that she hadn’t given her daughter the chance to learn a language.', '“We’ve tried to keep one afternoon absolutely free, but she’s already protesting that she doesn’t have any free time. She just wants time to herself. It’s been something that lockdown has given her, which has been great.” Now however, schools have fully reopened and the activities have kicked in once again.', '“Learning is important,” said Meheux. “However, without opportunities to play and engage with friends and family, children won’t have the capacity to engage with learning and thus achieve their full potential.”', 'Asked to respond, a Department for Education spokesperson cited the government’s £1.7bn catchup funding, including £950m to support pupils’ mental health, plus its sport and activity action plan. “We know young people have faced unprecedented challenges over the past year, including with wellbeing and development, and so support for pupil mental and physical health is a vital part of the recovery.”', '“It’s pretty miserable being a child,” said Gill, whose book No Fear has been described as a handbook for the movement for freer, riskier play. “No one is paying much attention to whether you are happy or healthy. They are just concerned about your grades.', '“The almost prison-like oversight of children’s time is really worrying – and not just in school.

Before then, children’s preoccupations are not reading, writing or arithmetic, but, said Salonen, herself a secondary-school teacher in the capital, “learning more important things”.', 'Those include, she says, how to make friends, communicate, be active, get creative, explore the outdoors and manage risk. “In Finland we feel children must be children, and that means playing – including, as much as possible, outdoors,” she said.', 'The main goal of kindergarten, which about 75% of three- to five-year-olds attend, according to the Finnish educational expert Pasi Sahlberg, is “not to prepare children for school academically, but to make sure they are happy and responsible individuals”.', 'It is a philosophy that extends a long way up the Finnish school system, which routinely features at or near the top or world rankings for childhood education. “Children should play in school, too,” said Salonen. “It’s important not just socially and physically, but mentally. They … concentrate better.”', 'Free and teacher-directed play embeds life and learning skills, Finnish educators believe, improving attention span, problem-solving abilities and perseverance. Outdoor play is especially valued, with a 15-minute outdoor break every hour up to secondary school.', 'Considered such a core activity that it is assessed by teachers, play in Finland is also about learning risk and responsibility – competences Finnish society promotes to the extent that it is common for even seven-year-olds to walk to school on their own.', 'In short, writes Sahlberg, “Finland’s insight can boost grades and learning for all students, as well as their social growth, emotional development, health, wellbeing and happiness. It can be boiled down to a single phrase: let children play.”', 'The need is particularly urgent in schools reopening after pandemic lockdowns, he argued, since play will mitigate stress, promote resilience and allow children to rebuild relationships through physical activity: “They need that much more than they need academic pressure, graded assignments and excessive screen time.”', 'The pandemic has also focused minds on the importance of play in Germany, where – although playgrounds have remained open since the end of the first lockdown – many parents and paediatricians say children’s needs have been at the bottom of the government’s agenda throughout the crisis.', 'Johannes Hübner, deputy director at Munich’s university children’s hospital, told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland that reduced social interaction and lack of physical exercise meant lockdown had come with “a lot of collateral damage” for children.', 'The Deutscher Kinderschutzbund, a lobby group for children’s rights, successfully campaigned at the end of last year against government plans to restrict social interaction among children under the age of 14. A planned rule to limit meetings to no more than two children was subsequently scrapped.', '“Playing with children of a similar aged is essential for children’s development,” said the lobby group’s director, Daniel Grein. “Children need other children. It’s right and good that the health and education of children has been discussed so widely throughout this pandemic.”', 'Not all education systems in Europe are like Finland’s, which places equality at its core, outlawing formal exams until age 18 and eschewing parental choice, selection, streaming by ability and league tables. But even in countries where testing and competition is the norm, the importance of play is increasingly being recognised.', 'Although school is not compulsory for children in Spain until the age of six, most children start off in pre-nursery or nursery far earlier so their parents can work. Before the age of six, education is divided into two stages: up to three, and three to six.', '“Generally speaking, there’s a very big play component in both those stages,” said Katia Hueso, a teacher, author and advocate of open-air learning. “But when children get into the second stage, you see the introduction of content and they start to work in a more structured way. Play begins to take quite a backseat.”', 'Free play is quite rare in the school environment, Hueso said. “It does exist – most obviously at breaktime – but it’s not something you see much in the classroom.” Some teachers, she said, use textbooks to teach children aged up to six years of age.', 'However, the way people in Spain live, with many families in flats with communal outdoor spaces, encourages outside play. “We’re an outdoor culture,” says Hueso. “That cuts across all ages and that outdoor culture is something kids benefit from.”', 'Elena Martín, a professor of psychology and education at the Autonomous University of Madrid, said the Spanish education system was generally “attached to the concept that learning has to be a ‘serious’ activity. So the idea of play doesn’t fit very easily into that – except when it comes to infant education.”', 'Play was “something that’s missing from the first stage of primary school”, Martín said. “It’s very difficult to find teachers who deliberately build it into their timetables for eight-year-olds”. Forthcoming reforms were meant to put more emphasis on investigation and flexibility, she said, but “much will depend on teacher training”.', 'Some countries are still a long way from the debate. Italian children start formal education at six, with parents able to choose a schedule in both primary and secondary of either 8.30am to 1pm (with a 20-minute break) or 8.30am to 4.30pm.', 'Those on the shorter schedule go home for lunch and are given homework each day, while those on the longer schedule, who also have a morning break, eat lunch at the school canteen and do homework at weekends.', '“The full-time hours are preferable as children can learn at a more relaxed pace,” said Liliana Bonfiglio, a mother-of-two in Rome. “Then they can dedicate time after school to other activities.”', 'The homework burden, however, has often been a cause of concern, particularly during holidays. Luca Barone, the mayor of the Sardinian town of Mamoiada, went so far as to ban homework during the long summer holiday.', 'Instead, Barone said, he encouraged children to “take long walks and watch the sunrise … It was more of a symbolic gesture than an actual law.

People, they argued, should not be judged by their wealth or class, but by merit alone. A university sector such as the one we have now, dependent on those who can afford to pay, is doomed. It cannot attract the best.', 'Young people are told they are “consumers” in a shop where they can choose what and when to learn. They can expect a “service”. Some have taken their university to court if their course did not “deliver” promised results. This is no longer a viable, decent learning environment in which students from all walks of life and cultures are supported to achieve their potential. This is not a place in which the next generation of citizens can flourish. The rise in the number of students suffering from mental health issue speaks volumes. A student suicide is “managed” by the media department for fear of bad publicity. What matters are “bums on seat” to keep the ship afloat.', 'Britain’s cherished higher education sector, once the envy of the world, is on the brink of collapse. The humanities were world leading – and still are in many areas. Scholars in English literature, creative writing, the arts, languages, history and philosophy were acclaimed across the globe. But now the sector as a whole is bankrupt, not just financially, but morally. It has lost its integrity and seems unwilling to engage in critical reflection about the causes of this unprecedented malaise.', 'Likewise, research is taking a massive hit in post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain. There is good evidence that the exodus of more than 10,000 scholars from Britain’s universities since the referendum continues unabated. Scotland has lost almost 2,500 academics. Countries such as Germany are beneficiaries of this mass migration of intellectual talent. Scholars and their families are voting with their feet. Britain is experiencing a significant “brain drain”. Life is too short to wait until the country has come to its senses is what most Europeans – and many British academics – think.', 'Berlin, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna and all the other major European cities have not been idle. They know this is a historic opportunity to attract some of the best minds in the world. At least one other German professorship has recently been awarded to a senior academic from Britain. I know scholars from around the UK who admit that the only reason for them to apply for grants is to increase their chances of leaving this sceptred isle.', 'The loss will be counted not only in intellectual and cultural capital, but in financial terms as well. Hundreds of millions of pounds will no longer be spent in Britain, but in the capitals of Europe. Thousands of post-docs and doctoral students will no longer flock to British universities to study with experts in their field but move instead to where they can find the best intellectual climate, the best infrastructure and career prospects. Britain’s attractiveness is waning.', 'In 2018, we marched with 700,000 for a People’s Vote. We printed our own shirts with graphics from Axel Scheffler’s Gruffalo. One said: “There is no such thing as a Brussalo”. Not everyone got the joke. It was my son’s first demonstration and we combined the trip with a lesson about democracy – and a bit of history too. It gave us hope that all was not lost, that things might turn out all right.', 'But the ship has sailed. The people (apparently) decided in a referendum to turn their back on Europe and there was no need to ask them again – it was a once-in-a-generation decision. Students and others who had not got up that day to vote later wondered if they should have. They lamented that they had been robbed.', 'On the day we learned that my wife’s British citizenship application had been successful, my son broke down in tears. For months he had worried that his mother would be “deported” after ministers – Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Brandon Lewis – said that EU citizens could be made to leave. The Brexit decision fundamentally changed our outlook on Britain as an open, welcoming society. It changed our sense of belonging. Trust, that invisible bond that links us to other people, had been broken.', 'Where does all this leave me and my family? I was awarded a €10m collaborative grant from the European Research Council to study the European “common good” with partners in Berlin, Sofia and Budapest. My share of the grant comes with me. The offer from a German university with a higher salary was attractive; the infrastructure and support on offer will be outstanding. So I guess my family and I will be fine. But the sense of loss has been inexplicably sad for me and for my British friends. Emotionally, there are huge question marks in our lives.', 'Why did all this have to happen? Perhaps we will never have an answer. For me, it has been a British love affair. I look forward to coming back – one day, perhaps.

Disabled students and those with caring responsibilities were more likely to have not received this support. The survey called for more help with students’ mental health and wellbeing, as well as more targeted, personalised teaching.', 'Among the students who have struggled with the shift to online learning is Aqsa Rabbani, a third-year midwifery student at Middlesex University. “I found remote learning quite hard,” she said. “I feel like there was a lack of communication from the university and there wasn’t much support online. My classmates would often have technical difficulties and it was hard to get used to. The government could have supplied more grants or reduced fees this year, especially for healthcare students like myself who have been working on placement throughout coronavirus.”', 'The NUS figures come after a similar poll published last week by the Office for Students (OfS), which highlighted the impact of digital poverty on students. Over half of respondents said they lacked access to online course materials during the pandemic.', 'Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students, said: “These findings chime with our own research which shows that a significant number of students were impacted by digital poverty during lockdown. Since the beginning of the pandemic, universities have been working hard to deliver high-quality education in extremely difficult circumstances. But as the new term starts, universities must ensure their digital offering is accessible for all and that no students are left behind, particularly the most disadvantaged.”', 'Last week, Barber announced a review of digital teaching and learning in English higher education to address the problem. “We want to know about what worked during the pandemic, what didn’t, and opportunities for the future. We cannot risk students being left behind in the rush for online innovation,” he said.', 'Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice president for higher education, said: “It’s evident from our research that the demand for academic support by students is going to go up even more than we’ve already seen during the pandemic, with many already turning to their students’ unions which have also been hit hard financially by Covid-19.”', 'As a new term begins this month, over half (56%) of the students surveyed by the NUS also said they were concerned about contracting the virus on university campuses.', 'In a recent interview with the Guardian, NUS president Larissa Kennedy said she was worried about a lack of consistency in universities’ safety measures. “[Universities are] committing to in-person teaching, which they haven’t necessarily thought through from a safety perspective because they’re in competition with other institutions,” she said. “Immunocompromised students and disabled students are once again being erased from the conversation, and of course their staff counterparts.”', ' This article was amended on 8 September 2020.

What steps is your department taking to ensure that every university that wishes to do so is able to deliver this capacity on their campus? And what progress is the government making to ensure there is sufficient testing capacity in university communities to ensure those who have symptoms can be tested quickly?”', 'At Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), 1,700 students told to quarantine for a fortnight are banned from leaving their flats to get a test, even though there is a walk-in centre less than a mile away.', 'At least one firm has offered to act pro bono for MMU students wanting to challenge the legality of their quarantine, with lawyers noting that in the community, those with symptoms are allowed to leave their homes to be tested.', 'Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, warned: “It is completely unacceptable – and potentially unlawful – for students to be subject to different rules than everyone else. This will only make public health guidance even more confusing and harder to follow.”', 'At MMU’s Cambridge halls of residence on Sunday, students had ignored orders from the university to take down signs they had put up in their windows using Post-it notes. “Fuck Boris with a cactus” read one; “9k 4 what?” read another, a reference to student fees.

We had an email yesterday saying that no one was allowed to leave for coronavirus testing,” he said.', 'The message from MMU said: “We appreciate some of you may need to take a Covid-19 test.

They will also be instructed to leave their accommodation with immediate effect.”', 'In a letter to the University of Birmingham, the West Midlands representative of the University and College Union, which represents lecturers and support staff, said the measure showed that “the university is unable to control the behaviour of a significant number of its students in campus accommodation”. ', 'The NUS also called for online learning to be the default and for functioning test and trace: “The NUS has long called for online learning to be the default, and the government must urgently invest in digital infrastructure and tackle digital poverty so that all students can continue to access their education remotely. We also need them to get a functional test-and-trace system in place on campuses and adequate funding to tackle the student mental health crisis,” said Kennedy, the union president.

We expect students to follow the guidance for self-isolation set out by the government and Public Health England. Our staff are on hand 24 hours a day to provide support, guidance and deal with concerns. We are unable to prevent our students from leaving the halls, but our students are bright young adults and we trust that they will do the right thing.”', 'Despite MMU students being prevented from leaving their flats to get tests, a government spokesperson said: “The message to students and staff is simple – get tested if you have symptoms … We are processing tests at unprecedented scale – 225,000 a day on average over the last week – and our approach means we are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most.” ']","Universities","News","2020-09-27",16.22,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e5e8a4edbca80adf07af95547ca52dceaa690b/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=3958cf94331e25801c69257d693ab0ca","Students in lockdown at Manchester Metropolitan University look out of their window marked with ‘9K 4 WHAT?’ in Post-its.

It would be better to commit to 100% online so staff can focus on that.”', 'Dawn and Jemma were among several staff who claimed their university had not taken a firm decision on their plans for the year until last month, and that some students were still without set timetables as educators scrambled to allocate classes.', 'Frustration among lecturers towards their universities and the government comes as students express fears over the psychological impact of the coronavirus crisis on campuses and call for money back from their tuition fees.', 'On Tuesday the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs it was “inevitable” there would be Covid-19 transmission among students, and that many universities had bolstered their mental health services for students facing added pressures from disruption and uncertainty.', 'Sam, a lecturer at Durham – where all lectures are online and some face-to-face teaching remains – said a number of students were already reporting mental health issues prior to the pandemic, and he was concerned that the university may not have the resources to deal with growing demand.', '“Pastoral care is a huge issue,” he said. “Government insistence that this is a problem for universities to deal with is ludicrous. What extra resources are we supposed to draw on to perform that role?”', 'Speaking more generally, and expressing concerns shared by multiple lecturers who responded to a Guardian callout, he added: “The government declined to offer financial aid in the spring, meaning that universities had to pretend everything would be OK by autumn and sell these students a vision of university that we knew we couldn’t guarantee.”', 'Another Russell Group academic, John, said: “Universities are dragging students back purely for financial reasons – we’ll go bust if we don’t.”', 'Sam said there was severe anxiety among lecturers and tutors who were “genuinely afraid of teaching their classes in person” and felt as if their concerns had fallen by the wayside at some universities. “Nobody seems to be listening.”', 'Meanwhile, some universities are grappling with particularly high numbers of first-year students due to the A-level grading fiasco, leaving academics feeling embattled.', '“I have nearly twice as many students as three years ago,” said Carlotta, a lecturer at UCL. “I feel a bit overwhelmed, I have anxiety problems.

Mocking of my accent was immediate and I was shocked at the perceptions of people from the north-east. The perception of me was that if I had a drink I would become aggressive and scrappy, and this was all because I was from the north. I am neither of those things.', '“One flatmate once asked me in genuine amazement: ‘You have BBC up where you’re from?’ I had to laugh, but looking back this moment neatly encapsulated the social position that many people imagined northern towns to be in. These little experiences made me feel like I did not belong at my university, that I’d gotten there by mistake. A feeling of otherness, imposter syndrome.', '“Fellow students expressed incredulity that I had made it top of the class in my first year. This incredulity rubbed off on me. Even when I graduated with first-class honours I was certain that I would never want to return to a university again.', '“Two years later, after living in another northern city, I had recovered my confidence and started my master’s at the University of Liverpool.

  ["UK's top universities urged to act on classism and accent prejudice","['Investigation finds widespread evidence of students being ridiculed over their backgrounds']","['Universities must act to eradicate discrimination against working-class students, including the mockery of regional accents, equality campaigners have said.', 'A Guardian investigation has found widespread evidence of students at some of the country’s leading universities being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds, in some cases prompting them to leave education.', 'The analysis found discrimination against working-class students was particularly prevalent among Russell Group universities. The group, which is made up of 24 institutions, has a reputation for academic excellence.', 'In a series of Guardian interviews, students past and present reported bullying and harassment over their accents and working-class backgrounds. Some said their academic ability was questioned because of the way they spoke.', 'The Social Mobility Commission (SMC), which monitors progress in improving social mobility in the UK, described the situation as unacceptable and said accents had become a “tangible barrier” for some students.', 'This week the Guardian reported complaints of a “toxic attitude” towards some northern students at Durham University. Last month the university launched an inquiry after wealthy prospective freshers reportedly planned a competition to have sex with the poorest student they could find. ', 'But experiences of classism and accent prejudice are not confined to Durham, said Sammy Wright, the lead commissioner on schools and higher education for the SMC. He said the government body had spent 18 months examining the differing chances for young people based on where they come from.', '“We found an entrenched pattern in certain areas where social mobility is very low, and often the only way to grasp opportunities involved moving away from where they were brought up – to go to university or find jobs,” said Wright, who is also vice-principal of Southmoor Academy in Sunderland.', '“But we also found that social and economic disadvantage often hampered any chance to move out. Accent is a part of this, alongside cultural capital and social networks. In my own work in schools in the north-east, accent can become a marker of everything else, a tangible barrier – most of all to the young people themselves, who internalise a sense of social inferiority.”', 'Wright said well-meaning university outreach teams were consistently failing in their efforts to reassure working-class students. “They promise their institutions are friendly and welcoming, but when that message comes in a home counties accent from bored middle-class students who have been sent into the north to deliver the message, my students are rightly sceptical.”', 'The Sutton Trust, a charity that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education, called on top universities to do more to ensure an inclusive and supportive environment for all undergraduates. ', 'Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s founder and chair, described the experiences of some students as “scandalous”. “It’s really tough for young people from low-income backgrounds to get into top universities. For this and for other reasons, it’s completely unacceptable that they are discriminated against while they’re there,” he said.', 'Analysis by the Office for Students (OfS), the government’s higher education regulator, shows that virtually all communities with the lowest levels of access to higher education are in industrial towns and cities of the north of England and the Midlands, and in coastal towns. For example, the most recent data shows that 55% of young people in London go into higher education but only 40% in the north-east.', 'The OfS director for fair access and participation, Chris Millward, said the issue of accent prejudice spoke to deeper inequalities in the education system. “It is crucial that universities strive to create an open and inclusive culture for all. There is no such thing as a ‘right’ accent or background for higher education – all students deserve the opportunity to thrive, no matter where they come from,” he said.', 'Sara Khan, a vice-president of the National Union of Students, said working-class students were sold a “myth of meritocracy”, but in some cases the reality was starkly different.', '“As long as working-class students have to pay for education, work alongside their studies to cover basic necessities, and are saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, higher education will never be a welcoming environment for them,” she said. “It is unfortunately inevitable that in a system like this, such students would face prejudice and harassment, which is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the classism in our education system.”', 'The Russell Group has been contacted for comment.']","Higher education","News","2020-10-24",7,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8ff2c9649a74d83026a4fcd85a101291f9228d/0_128_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=38a701270979b7d9f68d6a7ed5a2717a","University graduates.

Shortly after, she went home and deferred her place until next year, hoping that would prevent her health from worsening.', '“I think a lot of students had high expectations,” she told the Guardian. “We were all told things wouldn’t be too different, and we’d be fine. But when I first got there I realised the isolation and loneliness that I felt was really difficult to deal with.”', 'With no face to face lectures and most student societies moving online, coupled with the fact she lived in a studio flat, Maria, not her real name, had limited opportunities to make friends.', '“I already struggled with a lot of mental health issues before, especially severe anxiety,” she said. “I dealt with it badly before starting sixth form, and two years on I was making so much progress. I knew going to uni and moving away from home was bound to cause some anxiety, with a pandemic on top of that, but my mental health had never been worse than when I was self-isolating.', '“I lost my appetite and got tight stomach knots in the morning. I wasn’t eating for the first two to three weeks I was there.”', 'She asked to speak to a university counsellor but none was available for two weeks, although she was able to talk to the wellbeing team. After long conversations with family and friends, she decided to return home. She emphasised she had received plenty of support from the university.', '“I’m glad I came home, now I’m feeling fine and starting to improve on my anxiety, hopefully I’ll be better off next year. Other friends have said deferring has crossed their mind too.”', 'The university said it sympathised with students experiencing difficulties during self-isolation, and confirmed its wellbeing team had supported Maria. “As with anyone in this situation, our teams will keep in touch with them and support them in resuming their studies with us in the future,” a spokesperson said.', '“We have provided further support to make self-isolation a more comfortable experience, enabling households to isolate and take meals together, creating dedicated time and spaces for outdoor exercise, and offering a wide range of online films, theatre and other entertainments.”', 'Maria mentioned the death of 19-year-old Finn Kitson, a University of Manchester student who died in his halls during lockdown earlier this month after having “severe anxiety”, and said the government “definitely have some things to answer for”. His death is as yet unexplained.', 'Kitson’s father, the Cambridge academic Michael Kitson, criticised the University of Manchester. “If you lockdown young people because of Covid-19 with little support, then you should expect that they suffer severe anxiety,” he tweeted. ', 'Dr Simon Merrywest, director for the student experience at Manchester, said “all possible” support was being provided to the family and that the university had expressed its utmost sympathies. “The university is working closely with the Manchester coroner office, so we will not be able to comment any further,” he said.', 'Students across the UK have contacted the Guardian with serious concerns about the impact on their mental health of the restrictive measures imposed by universities. Their accounts come as the government’s scientific advisers said that while Covid posed less direct risk to younger people’s physical health, the pandemic could catastrophically damage their mental health and economic and social prospects.', 'Several students said the had deferred their place, dropped out, or have been considering doing so. Those who contacted the Guardian expressed widespread concern over a lack of support, even for students with Covid symptoms in quarantine.', 'Ioan Fowler, a first-year student at Bournemouth University, said: “When me and two other people in my flat tested positive we told our accommodation team, which is separate from the university, and they said we need to isolate for 10 days. Then we rang the university, and their support was zero. The university messaged me after about five days and said I could join a Facebook group chat with others in isolation. But by then it was too late – we felt let down.”', 'Fowler said he was shocked the university had not provided food parcels, particularly as some of his flatmates were being sick and experiencing dizziness from suspected coronavirus. Their isolation period ended last week.', '“We were all told that we needed to order food online, but I couldn’t get a delivery so my parents had to bring me a food package from Wales,” he said. “I’m paying over nine grand a year, I expect to have some sort of support when things go south, but there was just nothing.”', 'Bournemouth University said it was working hard to provide support to students self-isolating or who had tested positive. In an attempt to address the crisis, older students at some universities were providing one-to-one support to students struggling under the pandemic restrictions, particularly first years in quarantine.', 'At Bristol University, Sam Fearon, a second-year student and member of the university’s Project Talk society, said volunteers were being trained and would be “put in contact with students who may be suffering, to make friendly one-to-one calls”. The project launched on Wednesday, coinciding with the university’s announcement of the death of a third year student.', 'Fearon added: “It almost feels it would have been better if students had stayed at home given the mental hardship some are going through.”']","Higher education","News","2020-10-22",11.35,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c210d10f5ee1745ea02fe9f1188bd67cab5f0c/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=1c3c43a407bc413b642cad4217fcbb19","A sign in the window of student accommodation.
